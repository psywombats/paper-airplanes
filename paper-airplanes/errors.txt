        Opening the glass doors, we entered the large room, the heavenly aroma of different types of foods wafting to our noses.
        It was two in the afternoon, so the cafeteria was still rather crowded with residents or visitors alike.

        Toma turned and walked towards the counter where the food was being sold, lining up in the fourth line.
        I turned around, facing the many tables that were already occupied, leaving only a small selection free.
        Of course, all of the seats right next to the tall windows were taken, the occupants fawning over the scenery.
        I smiled at the sight of the happy residents, glad that they were enjoying the scenery.
        I began to walk towards the back of the cafeteria, where a table laid lonesome by itself.
        Many people disliked sitting at this area due to the lack of light. {w=1.0} However, I found it to be more reason to sit there.
        Perhaps it was just me, but I had always enjoyed sitting in a low light area. {w=1.0} The strong heat coming off of the lightbulbs and the bright light shining had always bothered me.
        Once I reached the lonesome table, I pulled out a chair and sat down, facing the rest of the cafeteria.

            The curse that had fallen upon my mother and me versus the curse that fell on the fictional child... {w=4.0} So different and yet so similar.

        Toma's soup was gone shortly after, leaving him only his cup of coffee and doughnuts.

    I smiled at Toma's words, feeling the genuine gratitude behind them as he turned around and began to jog forward.
             ^
        I stopped in front of my door, watching Toma jog off into the distance before taking a sharp left turn, where an elevator awaited him.
        I smiled in relief at Toma's safe trip, glad that he didn't fall or trip while jogging.
        I placed my hand on the doorknob, and began to turn when a loud slam snapped my attention to the area behind me.
        To my surprise, down the hall, a young boy about my age held onto a doorknob for dear life as he struggled to stand.
        His raven-black hair covered his eyes as he looked around, his head turned to my direction.
        I blinked in surprise when his emerald green eyes met mine; they sent a shiver down my spine.
        I held my book close to my chin on instinct, considering it as a small barrier between he and I.
        c "Ah, um... {w} H-Hello."
        I stuttered, feeling his eyes glaring daggers at me, making me rather nervous.
        The boy said nothing as he turned around, his feet clumsily tripping on each other while he began to walk forward.
        My eyes slowly drifted towards his shoulders, causing another shiver to run down my spine at the flapping left sleeve.
        Where one would usually find a left arm, that boy had nothing.
        I recalled Toma's words about the accident victim losing something valuable. {w=1.0} That boy must be the new resident then!

    I flinched at the voice, instantly recognising it to be Meadow's.

        I turned around and saw Meadow marching forward, a serious and slightly surprised look on her face.
        c "Oh, hello Meadow!"
        m "Miss Celia, please get inside your room."
        I blinked in surprise as Meadow marched right past me, quickening her pace as the boy staggered to the right wall, using his right arm as a support.
        Meadow grabbed the boy's shoulders, causing him to flinch and instantly start shaking her off.

    I don't think it would hurt to go and see what is going on.
        After a good solid three minutes of debating with myself, I mustered up as much courage as I could and moved my breakfast tray to the side. 
        With a deep breath, I slid out from my blanket, letting my feet hit the ground.
        n "Nyu!"
        I looked over to Nyu, who was giving me quite the stern look from her glossy eyes.
        c "I'm just a little curious Nyu. I won't be gone for too long, alright?"
                  ^
        n "Nyu..."
        I gave her a quick reassuring smile as I unhooked my bag of IV and carried it gently in my arms.
        Usually, I would go "mobile" by putting my IV into a small vial, but I didn’t want to waste any time.
        Leaving Nyu by her lonesome, I walked over to the door and hesitantly opened it.
        If I had to be honest with myself... {w=3.0} I was a little nervous.
        Many people come to this hospital for a variety of different purposes, ranging from casual checks ups to drastic emergencies.
        If I head down there, I might see something horrible…
        A broken leg…
        A dislocated shoulder…
        Or maybe even a black eye…
        ...Or blood.
        A cold shiver of fear ran up and down my spine at the thought of what I might see.
        I shook my head, pushing the negative and fearful thoughts out.
        I will only be there for a moment, take a glance of the situation, and then leave before anyone can notice me.
        With a confident nod, I took a proud step out of my room.
        I looked down the hallway before taking another step, noticing that the nurse’s station not to far from my room is rather empty.
        Using this to my advantage, I stealthily ran towards the elevator. 
        It would be a lot more troublesome to take the stairs.
        The other doctors and nurses would have a higher chance of noticing me if I took the stairs, and they would instantly notice me thanks to the incident four years ago.
        Once I reached the elevator, I quickly pressed the button five times in desperation while looking both to the left and right, making sure not to get myself caught..
        I took a step back and impatiently waited for the elevator. 
        As I waited, I suddenly heard two low voices - most likely two men - shouting. 
        Their voices were mixed with the rapid sounds of stomping footsteps.
        I gasped softly in worry, trying to find a place to hide.

        My body became tight; I found myself frozen in place.
        My eyes strained to stay open as I stood there, motionless aside from my throbbing heart. 
        Something isn't right.
        The panicked voices of the men started to blend with their footsteps, fading away into an abyss, where I couldn't hear anything.
        My chest... hurts...! {w=1.0} I-I'm scared…
        What's going on?
        My knee trembled, ready to lose their strength as my heartbeat rang in my ears like the lasting notes from a base drum.
        Each breath I took stabbed my body; waves of pain flowed through my body endlessly.
        It hurts... {w=4.0} So much…
        Slowly, my blood began to turn cold... 
        My heartbeat stopped as a momentous sound rung in my ears.
        My legs now felt numb as I let out a soft sigh.
        My eyelids suddenly became heavy, closing against my will and blocking me out of the vivid world I was in only moments ago…

        Today is also the fourteenth anniversary of my Mother's death.
        She had died the very same day, if not the exact moment, I was born.
        Today is a day of joy, and yet it is also a day of sadness.
        A majority of my friends mainly remembered today as Mother's death...
        With a soft sigh, I quickly shook my head at the thought of "sadness", not wanting to ruin my birthday.
        I'm sure my mother wouldn't have wanted me to be sad on such a special day.
        The \"H.B.C\" must stand for \"Happy Birthday Celia.\" {w} They are the three letters that Nyu could manage to write.

        m "I've been ordered to call you \"Miss Celia\" as a symbol of your 14th birthday. You're practically a young lady now!"
        I puffed out my cheeks in slight disapproval at her \"orders\", feeling like it was a bit unnecessary.
        Meadow giggled at my reaction and pinched my cheeks, causing me to smile a little.
        m "Come on, no need to be like that! Orders are orders, Celia. There is nothing I can do."

        Mixed with the bitter smell of ketchup, crisp bread and salted butter, the smell of the freshly cooked eggs and rice began to waft its way towards my nose, causing my stomach to growl once again but louder this time.
        Meadow couldn't help but laugh at the sound of my growling stomach.

        c "Hehe... Well, yes. {w=1.0} After all, you were six minutes later than usual."

        Before I could open my mouth to ask Meadow why she had told me to stay in my room when it was such a common thing for me, she swiftly turned around and left, the door closing gently behind her.

    It didn't matter who, Toma always had a way to push the buttons of anyone he meets.
        In order to stay on that person's good side, he'll say that he was only teasing them.

        However, he seems to only pat my head when clarifying his way of teasing.
        t "Come on, let's go."
        I smiled and nodded, the two of us walking side by side as Toma began to tell me stories of his adventure away from the hospital.
        [Transition/In the library]
        I stretched my arms in the air in delight, taking in the lovely scenery of bookshelves carrying the many different types of literature inside of them.
        The library rarely sees any visitors, so it is the perfect place to forget your troubles and dive into a new world.
        Along with the small signs of plant life on the window and the faint sky-blue colored walls, time quickly passes here. It is the true sanctuary for those wanting to escape reality.
        At the moment, my favorite section is science fiction.
        c "Ah...! The library! So many books to explore!"
        t "More like so many books to snore..."
        I gave Toma a sharp look at his remark, causing him to laugh nervously.
        t "Hey, don't give me that look! {w=1.0} I'm just kidding~!"
        I puffed out my left cheek, showing that I wasn't going to let Toma off the hook so easily with his remark.
        Toma laughed a little as he walked forward, smiling nervously at me as he pointed somewhere in the distance.
        t "A-Anyways, I'm pretty sure that this place has gotten a fantasy aisle recently. {w=1.0} Want to check it out?"
        c "Huh? Fantasy?!"
        t "Yeah, fantasy. {w=1.0} Come on, it's this way."
        Toma took the lead and began to walk towards the left corner of the library, the sounds of our footsteps bouncing off the walls and echoing in our ears.
        The smell of books and flowers filled the air, forming a comfortable and soothing atmosphere.
        {Bookshelf}
        t "If folklore and legends are over here then... {w=2.0} Here we are! Fantasy."
        Toma placed his hands behind his head in victory and stepped to the side as I walked forward, entering the narrow aisle between the bookshelves.
        c "Amazing...! You really know your way around the library, Toma!"
        Despite the library's simple but calming interior, the bookshelves and books themselves all look fairly similar, forcing visitors to be at a complete loss about which book to get.
        t "Ah, well... {w=3.0} That's not really true."
        t "The bookshelf right next to us is all about folklore and legends dating all the way back to Ion's time. {w=1.0} I'll be the first to know about anything new around this general area."
        I giggled as Toma made a heart with his hands, pointing it towards the direction of a bookshelf nearby.
        This was the one thing I had always found amusing with Toma.
        He loves anything about Mion's past era, including the "Old World" era, where our world was at its most hideous state.

        I looked down at my arms as Toma pointed at the three spines facing him.
        c "Oh, alright! Which one do you want?"
        t "Doesn't matter, I'll just take one of the books you won't be reading."
        Toma slumped down in his seat and pushed the seat across from him, telling me to sit there as it was my usual spot.
        I took a seat, placing the three books I had selected randomly in a row in front of Toma and me.
        Hm... Which book should I read?

        Toma instantly opened up the cover and began to read, his head resting on his left hand as his eyes slowly scanned the words.
        While Toma read his book in the most indifferent way possible, I looked over to the right of me, where the window we had sat next to glowed its normal radiance of pure sunlight.
        There, right in front of the window, was a field of white.
        But not of snow. {w=1.0} It was a field of daisies.
        Normally, such a plain flower wouldn't be so beautiful, {w=1.0} but the sight of a field of white petals gently swaying in the wind, glowing in the rays of the sun, makes them much more appealing than normal.

        t "Can you return these for me?"
        The librarian smiled and nodded.
        librarian "Of course, sir."

        librarian "But of course, Miss Celia."
        I gave my book to the librarian, a nervous smile forming as the words \"Miss Celia\" echoed in my ears.
        Even the librarian was ordered to call me by that name.
        A stiffening silence fell over Toma and I as we patiently watched the Librarian swiftly checking out the book.
        With a loud thump from the check out stamp that printed the date of return on a little sheet, the librarian offered the book back to me.
        Librarian "I apologize for the wait. Here you are Miss Celia."
        My body flinched as she called me by that name once again, hesitantly taking the book back.

        Meadow and Toma's stories match, which is a good thing, but it doesn't really give me all the answers I wanted.

        Toma jumped at my words, the tips of his ears turning as red as a cherry.
        For some reason, the elders \"ooh\"ed and \"ahh\"ed at the scene before them, some of the elderly woman giggling like children.
        c "Well, I am a girl and your friend, correct? {w=1.0} So, I'm your girl friend!"
        Toma's red face turned pale in seconds, as his once gaping mouth closed shut.
        t "Ah, that's right. {w=1.0} That's very true."
        The elders began to laugh once again, those who didn't need a wheelchair standing up and patting Toma on the back.
        I smiled warmly at the scene, finding it comforting but very confusing as well.
        elderly_a "Well, how about another round gang?"
        The elderly cheered in delight, wobbling over to their wheelchairs in delight.
        I smiled brightly at the sight, turning to Toma and tugged on one of his white sleeves.

        I waved goodbye to the elderly as Toma and I began to continue walk around.
        [Transition]
        Toma and I walked across the wing, entering the third floor of the main building.
        The third floor was used as some sort of relaxation center, where a majority of hospital residents and their visitors hung out in.
        Despite the rather large number around, the area was quiet and had a relaxing atmosphere.
        Toma and I stopped walking for a bit, examining the area. 
        People of different ages were sitting down, all chatting happily about whatever they wanted.
        I smiled at the sight of a little girl, talking happily with her mother and father.
        Despite the little girl's mother's wearing a hospital gown, the family looked so happy together.
        As I continued to look around the room, I noticed a young man wearing bandages on his head, smiling sheepishly as he spoke to an older woman. {w=1.0} Most likely his mother.
        I began to remember about the commotion from this morning, the new resident of the third floor...
        I never found out who they were or how they ended up there.
        Sure, Meadow told me some information, but it doesn’t really answer the many questions I had in my head.
        I turned my attention to the nurses' station in the left corner, where nurses were smiling gently at the sight of all the happy patients.
        I smiled at them as a few noticed me, and began to walk over to them.
        The head nurse of the station, a friendly woman with long black hair tied into a bun, noticed me walking towards her and gave a warm smile.
        c "Good afternoon!"
        nurse "Well, good afternoon. {w=1.0} It's rare to see you two together!"
        I looked over my shoulder and saw Toma standing right next to me, his hands tied behind his head. 
        Without even noticing, he had followed me to the nurses station.
        It was only natural, seeing as how he could never leave me by myself. {w=5.0} But for some reason, I felt a little upset about it.
        t "Well, today's special."
        nurse "Oh?"
        t "It's Celia's birthday today! {w=1.0} I thought it'd be nice to celebrate by having lunch together."
        I looked at Toma in surprise.
        We’re going to eat lunch together? {w=2.0} That means we get to eat flan today~!
        The nurse began to giggle in a mischievous way, the other nurses in the station smiling brightly at us.
        nurse "My, how kind of you Toma~!"
        t "H-Hey! {w=2.0} What's with that look you're giving me?"
        The nurse didn't reply, as she and the others began to giggle.

File "game/script.rpy", line 805: expected statement.
(Perhaps you left out a ' at the end of the first line.)
    I looked over to the nurse’s, just in time to see them begin to nod - agreeing with Toma's claim.
                                ^
        c "Oh, so it was just another accident victim?"
        t "Not exactly."
        t "The person lost something valuable to them, and needs to be supervised. {w=2.0} It is, after all, the reason they are a third floor resident."
        c "Oh, I see..."
        I looked down at my feet and wiggled my bare toes.
        Meadow and Toma’s stories match, which is a good thing, but it still doesn’t really give me all the answers I wanted.
        Why was there such a commotion when it happened?
        Why doesn’t Meadow want me to meet with this new resident?
        Nothing makes sense...
        And what did they lose?
        A body part? {w=0.5} Something of a momento? {w=1.0} Or maybe... Someone important to them...
        My heart instantly went out to them at the mere thought of losing someone, the familiar feeling of loneliness dwelling inside me.
        c "How awful... {w=6.0} I wish I could have helped them out in some way."
        t "It's not your fault for their loss, Celia. {w=2.0} There was nothing anyone could have done."
        My body tensed at Toma curt words.
        There was truth in what he said, but I couldn't help but think otherwise.
        Couldn't there have been something, {i}anything{/i} that someone could have done? {w=4.0} Anything at all?
        Humans have the ability to choose what fate they want to have, and my mother was proof of that in the beginning.
        The fact that there was nothing someone could have done to save the accident victim... {w=5.0} It hurts me.
        After another ten minutes or so, Toma's stomach began to growl.
        With the fun air from earlier now back, the two of us said goodbye to the nurses and made our way to the second floor of the main hospital where the cafeteria awaited us.

        Hmm... I really shouldn't disobey Meadow... I would probably be a nuisance for the people downstairs as well.
        And besides, knowing Meadow, she'd tell me at least the basic story of what happened.
        Nodding with determination, I returned my attention to my food and continued to eat.
        [Transition]
        The time is now 8:30, and Meadow still hadn't returned. {w=3.0} Something terrible really must have happened.
        I hope not too many people were hurt...
        Thankfully, the cries of panicked voices died down half an hour ago. {w=2.0} Everything must have gotten settled around then.
        n "Nyu! Nyu nyui, nyu nyu, nyui!"
        Nyu puffed out her cheeks in frustration as she weakly but indignantly stomped her little paw on the bed.
        Nyu and I decided to play a game of charades while we waited for time to pass by.
        Nyu naturally isn't very good at the game. {w=2.0} She can only do so much without a real pair of hands, so it is rather easy to tell what she is trying to say.
        c "Hehe, having trouble figuring out what to do next?"
        n "Nyuuu...!"
        I couldn't help but giggle at Nyu's frustrated response; I see that she is trying to act stubborn.
        As Nyu continued to ponder about what she should do, the door opened, catching my attention.
        c "Meadow!"
        m "Heh, I'm back! {w=1.0} Did you miss me?"
        I giggled at Meadows words as she walked towards me. Her normal bright smile plastered on her face.
        I turned as much of my body as I could toward her, slowly gathering courage to ask her about the commotion from earlier.
        c "So, Meadow... {w=4.0} I'm sorry, but I have been curious about it. What happened downstairs on the first floor? Was it just another accident victim?"
        Meadow's eyes widened slightly as she stared at me in silence.
        She looked at me as if she had no knowledge of what I was speaking about.
        Meadow closed her eyes, deep in thought.
        m "... {w=2.0} No, it wasn't."
        I blinked twice in slight confusion by Meadow's frank answer.

File "game/script.rpy", line 859: expected statement.

    \"A rare case..?\" {w=1.0} Even though I could tell that there was some hesitation in Meadow's words, I could hear the pure sincerity behind her explanation.

        ...However, I had a feeling that this was the best Meadow was willing to share with me at the moment.
        m "Anyway, because it is a rare case... {w=1.0} The victim will be staying up here on the third floor. He was hurt pretty badly, and so we will need to be monitored daily."
        c "Oh, I see..."
        I couldn't help but pity the poor soul.
        The third floor of the hospital was where the people who were greatly injured or couldn't take care of themselves had to stay. {w=1.0} Almost all of the residents on this floor are above the age of 55.
        c "Oh! I have an idea!"
        Meadow blinked in surprise at my sudden announcement.
        m "Hmm?"
        c "May I please welcome the new resident? {w} After being in such a horrible accident, they must be very scared and possibly even lonely-{nw}"
        m "Absolutely not."
        I flinched in surprise at Meadow's quick response, thrown off completely by her sudden serious expression.
        m "Miss Celia, I would prefer it if you did not go any where near the new resident."
        c "Eh...?"
        m "Do not go near any strangers you might see."
        I stare at Meadow in confusion and slight nervousness, my hands trembling slightly.
        c "...A-Alright..."
        Meadow smiled her usual smile.
        m "Good."
        Despite Meadow's new carefree smile, I couldn't help but sense a more serious and slightly terrifying atmosphere emitting from her.
        I don't even know what the new resident looks like, and Meadow is telling me not go anywhere near them.
        ...
        I can't help but become more and more curious about this new resident...

        It is now 11:30 in the morning, half an hour before lunch time.

        c "And... {w=2.0} Done!"

        c "Well? What do you think?"
        n "Nyu..."
        Nyu shook her head in disapproval at my hard work, causing me to giggle nervously.
        c "Oh come on, it isn't that bad..."
        Nyu puffed out her cheeks, placing her stubby paws on her hips.
         It looks like she isn't going to change her opinion.
