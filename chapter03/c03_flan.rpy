    Hm... [Pause] Alright! I'll get it for him!
    I took a deep breath, opened the door and confidently marched towards the cup of flan.
    As I approached the cup, I swallowed loudly as my courage suddenly disappeared.
    c "I'm sorry, Miss Nurse who wanted to eat this flan..."
    c "But I need it to make someone feel better!"
    I hesitantly grabbed the cup, turned around, and nervously ran back to the boy's room.
    I closed the door slightly like before, pressing my back on the door.
    I looked over to the boy, who looked rather shocked by my actions.
    He must have thought that I wouldn't do it.
    c "Ehehe... [Pause] Well..."
    c "Here you go! Make sure you eat all of it!"
    With a smile, I extended the cup of flan to the stunned boy.
    He hesitantly took the cups from my hands, his eyes returning to their usual emotionless state.
    Boy "..."
    The boy remained quiet as he nodded to me.
    I smiled and nodded back, feeling a thank you of gratitude behind his nodding.
    ??? "Celia? [Pause] Celia, where are you?"
    c "Hm?"
    ??? "Celia, now isn't the time for hide and go seek!"
    c "Ah, it's Toma!"
    boy "...?"
    c "I'm sorry, but I have to go now." 
    c "Don't forget to take your medication! [Pause] Put all of it on your tongue and start drinking the water."
    c "Don't stop drinking the water, just drink all of it! [Pause] That way, you don't have to worry about the medication getting stuck in your throat."
    boy "?!"
    I smiled once more to the boy before turning around and left the room.
    Closing the door behind me, I noticed that Toma was standing in front of my door, looking down the other side of the hallway.
    I jogged over to Toma, my bare feet slapping on the ground that seemed to have caught Toma's attention.
    t "Celia!"
    c "Hello, Toma! [Pause] A nice surprise to see you down here."
    t "Never mind that, why in Ion's name were you not in your room?!"
    I flinched at Toma's stern loud voice, my body tensing up.
    c "I-I'm sorry... [Pause] I just... wanted to welcome the new resident over at room 294..."
    t "I thought that you were instructed to stay in your room at all times unless supervised!"
    I looked down at my face, feeling guilty from Toma's angry tone.
    t "..."
    t "Sorry... [Pause] Just...don't do this again."
    I nodded obediently in reply, not looking up to meet Toma's eyes.
    t "...Hey." 
    t "I was sent on a coffee errand from the old man. Want to tag along and get something to drink?"
    c "... [Pause] Yes, please."
    t "Heh, alright then." 
    t "Do you have everything? Your mobile?"
    c "...Mm-hmm..."
    t "... [Pause] Hey, I'm not mad anymore, okay?"
    t "I was just worried about you. [Pause] I didn't mean to yell."
    t "So cheer up! [Pause] How is the world supposed to go round if you aren't happy?"
    c "..."
    c "... [Pause] You're right."
    t "There we go... [Pause] Now, let's head off, shall we?"
    Toma gently patted my head, his hand sliding to my shoulder as he guided me down the hall.
    There was a somewhat stiffening silence between us as we walked, my bear feet softly hitting the marble floor.
    t "You said that you welcomed the new resident of this floor, right?"
    c "Mm-hm."
    t "Well, what do you think of them?"
    c "What do I think...?"
    t "Yeah, is he good person or what?"
    I fell silent at Toma's question, looking up to the ceiling as I thought about an answer.
    That boy... [Pause] He was rather...
    
    menu:
        "Interesting":
            c "The new resident is a young boy about my age and... [Pause] He's very interesting."
            t "Oh? [Pause] How so?"
            c "He seems as if he really wants to leave this place... [Pause] He is also rather quiet and often uses his eye to scare people away."
            c "I think that being in the accident has really hurt his ability to trust people."
            c "But at the same time, he is rather open. [Pause] After I had helped him with something, he seemed a bit more gentle than he was before."
            c "I really want to help him. [Pause] He seems to be only about my age after all, so he shouldn't really have to go through this...being in a hospital."
            t "Hm..." 
            t "In that case, I'll help him out too." 
            c "Really? [Pause] Hehe, thank you Toma!"
            I smiled at Toma as we continued down the hall, soon talking about what drink to get.

        "Strange":
            c "The new resident is a young boy about my age and... [Pause] He's very...strange."
            t "Huh? [Pause] Strange how and in what way?"
            c "Well, he is really quiet and mostly stared at me when I talked with him."
            t "He stared at you?"
            c "Basically, yes. [Pause] His eyes were screaming distrust and wariness towards me."
            c "I think that being in the accident has really hurt his ability to trust people."
            c "But because of that... [Pause] I really want to help him." 
            c "He seems to be only about my age after all, so he shouldn't really have to go through this...being in a hospital."
            t "Hm..."
            t "I don't like the sound of this guy."
            c "Hm?"
            Toma's eyes shifted to the side as we walked, a slight look of disgust in his eyes.
            t "I mean, if he's staring at you then I can give a guess as to why, which kind of bothers me."
            t "Especially since you're in that... [Pause] Everyone knows that there's nothing underneath."
            Toma's face reddened a little bit as he began to furiously scratch his head, his teeth gritting in distress.
            t "Ugh, when is that stupid thing going to come in?!"
            c "Um, Toma? [Pause] Are you alright?"
            t "Huh?"
            t "Oh, I'm fine."
            t "But hey, do me a favor and don't get too close to him, got it?"
            t "If he keeps on staring at you, let me know and I'll tell the guy to stop."
            c "Huh? [Pause] Um, well alright."
            I smiled in confusion at Toma as we continued down the hall, soon talking about what drink to get.

    [Transition]
    It was now 6:18 in the evening, the hospital hallway lights dimmed down to settle an atmosphere of passing time.
    c "Hm..."
    I was working on my history worksheets that Alalia had given me as homework, the ticking and beeping softly echoing in my room.
    As I scribbled down my answers for the multiple choice selection, the opening of the door caught my attention.
    m "Good evening, Miss Celia."
    I nodded in reply, writing down the page number of the textbook that I would need for a short answer.
    m "Come on, little miss worker. [Pause] Put down the pencil and eat your food."
    c "Hold on, let me just... [Pause] There!"
    Placing down my pencil, I stretched my arms up into the air with a hum, pushing my chair a bit as I also stretched my legs.
    I stood up and walked over to my bed, where Meadow had stood next to with a tray of a small plate with green vegetables and a cup of water for my medicine.
    m "How are you doing? [Pause] Do you need any help?"
    c "Thank you, but I'm fine."
    c "The whole purpose of homework is to figure it out yourself, right? [Pause] To see how much you know?"
    Meadow chuckled as I sat down on my bed, the tray placed right on top of my legs as usual.
    Picking up the fork, I smiled at the small serving of salad and began to eat.
    m "Actually, watching you eat reminds me of something good that happened today."
    c "Oh?"
    m "The new resident? [Pause] Well, when I went to go and get his lunch, I saw that he had actually eaten his food!"
    m "Not everything, but it's a start."
    c "Really?! [Pause] That's great!"
    I smiled happily at the news, fiddling with my salad as soft giggles escaped.
    m "Hey, what's so funny? [Pause] For someone you don't know, you seem rather happy.
    c "Ah, well..."
    I pressed my lips together as I glanced away from Meadow.
    m "...?"
    m "Miss Celia, are you hiding something?"
    c "Huh? [Pause] W-What brought that on?"
    m "Well, when you want to keep something to yourself, you press your lips together."
    c "Really, I do? [Pause] Eheheh, I-I haven't noticed!"
    m "Miss Celia, what are you hiding?"
    I glanced around the room, avoiding Meadow's questioning eyes.
    She would be very upset if I told her that I had disobeyed her and met the boy in person...
    n "Nyu!"
    m "Hm?"
    I turned my attention to Nyu, who was sitting comfortably next to me.
    n "Nyu, nyu! Nyui!"
    c "Huh? [Pause] Really, you think so?"
    c "But..."
    n "Nyu...!"
    m "What did she say, Miss Celia?"
    I took a deep breath as I finally locked eyes with Meadow, puffing out my cheeks.
    c "... [Pause] Shortly after you gave me my lunch, I went and visited the boy."
    m "... [Pause] Huh?"
    c "I-I went and... visited the boy today."
    c "I'm really sorry, but I didn't want to sit here and do nothing!"
    c "When someone gets hurt in an accident, I think that the best course of action is to give them the nurturing love they need!" 
    c "And well... [Pause] He looks about my age so..."
    c "I know better than most people how lonely it can be in a hospital with no friends your own age..."
    Meadow fell silent at my words, her eyes blankly staring at me in surprise.
    I awaited for her to react, nibbling on my salad while my eyes continued to lock with Meadow's dazed ones.
    After half of my salad was finished, Meadow's eyes were filled with emotion again as she started to think about something.
    m "... [Pause] I see... That's very interesting."
    c "Hm?"
    Meadow ignored my confusion, kissed me on the forehead, turned around and left the room.
    That was odd... [Pause] I had thought that Meadow was going to be a bit more upset at my actions.
    Maybe she took my words into consideration and realized I didn't harm anyone?
    Well, it doesn't matter. [Pause] I'm just glad that I didn't get scolded by Meadow as well today.
    Time moved on as I quickly finished my meal, returning to my homework before going to bed at 8:00.
    I was happy that I was able to help someone today...
    That makes it... [Pause] Five now.
    I smiled in the darkness, hugging Nyu gently in my arms as my eyes fluttered closed.
    I was halfway there...
    The mere thought makes me so happy...
