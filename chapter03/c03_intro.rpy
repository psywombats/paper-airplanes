    [Chapter 3: Welcome]
    [ADV]
    My eyes slowly fluttered open.
    What had originally planned to be a nap turned out to be a slumber that lasted the entire night.
    With a small yawn, I sat up on my bed and stretched my arms high into the air.
    n "Nyu..."
    c "Oh... [Pause] Good morning, Nyu."
    Another yawn escaped my lips as I gently rubbed my heavy eyelids.
    I looked over to the window, my eyelids closing my eyes halfway.
    Ah, it looks like it will be a nice day again. [Pause] Lots of sunshine.
    Nyu wobbled over to me and laid down on my lap, yawning softly in exhaustion. 
    I smiled at the tired Nyu and gently began to rub her head, humming a gentle tone.
    As I hummed, I looked over to the door's small window, staring out to the nurses station.
    The nurses looked rather tired this morning, all greeting one another with sleepy looks.
    Perhaps it was the heat from the sun that was getting to them? [Pause] The hospital is rather warm this morning.
    Smiling at the cheerful nurses, I turned my attention back to Nyu and closed my eyes, listening to my awful and off key humming that seemed to have been comforting to Nyu.

    It was seven twenty when Meadow entered my room with bright eyes and a happy smile with a tray of food in hand as usual.
    m "Good morning, Miss Celia!"
    c "Ah... G-Good morning..."
    The "Miss" threw me off once again. [Pause] I had thought that Meadow would have noticed my discomfort in the sudden name calling, but it seems that she will truly stick to this one.
    Meadow's voice had woke up Nyu, causing her to roll off my lap and lazily slide underneath the blanket as Meadow walked towards me.
    m "I apologize, but your rice omelet is a little smaller than normal this morning."
    m "Something rather upsetting and surprising occurred last night, and... [Pause] Our rice supply has decreased due to it. I'm sorry.
    c "Oh, is that so? [Pause] What happened?"
    m "A-Ah, well... [Pause] Just a little argument, I guess."
    c "Oh my, did anyone get hurt?"
    m "Thankfully, no."
    Meadow placed the tray down on top of my lap. Like she had said, the omelet that would usually take up most of the plate was barely covering the middle of the plate.
    I picked up my fork and gently cut the middle of the omelet.
    What would usually spill out half of white steaming strands of rice with a thin layer of the egg was only a small ounce of rice with a rather thick layer of eggs.
    I smiled sadly at the sight, finding myself in a bit of a stressful situation.
    c "Oh, dear... [Pause] Do you know exactly how long this rice issue will last?"
    m "I'm not sure, Miss Celia... [Pause] The amount of rice has been decreasing due to some circumstances with the local farmers."
    m "It could take a while before we get some more rice. So once it's out, we'll have to be on a rice free diet."
    c "Hmm... If it can't be helped, then that's how it goes."
    m "I'm sorry..."
    c "Oh no, it's perfectly fine! [Pause] There are other patients after all."
    Meadow smiled sadly as I began to eat the thick layer of egg.
    Meadow began to do her usual routine of checking my heart rate status.
    [Transition]
    Once my breakfast was finished, Meadow and I began to talk for a bit about anything and everything that came to our minds.
    m "Oh, it's already that time..."
    c "Hm? [Pause] Is there something wrong, Meadow?"
    m "Ah, no no, not at all. [Pause] Excuse me, I'll be right back."
    Meadow stood up and walked out of the room, leaving Nyu and I confused.
    c "Where is she going, I wonder..."
    n "Nyu..."
    Nyu climbed on top of my shoulders to my head, her wing shaped ears wiggling along with her actions.
    I smiled at Nyu's actions, glancing up at her before back at the door.
    After ten minutes, Meadow returned with an upset look on her face.
    c "Welcome back, Meadow. [Pause] Is everything okay?"
    m "Ah, um... [Pause] Yeah. Everything is fine."
    Despite Meadow's words, it sounded as if she was rather upset about something.
    I stared at her with a nervous smile as Nyu slid out and flew towards her.
    Meadow sighed as she sat down next to me, Nyu landing on her head.
    m "You see... [Pause] That boy you saw yesterday..."
    c "Oh, the boy is the one who was in the accident correct? [Pause] The one who ‘lost something valuable'?"
    m "Huh?"
    c "Toma told me about him and how he was involved in a ‘ wreck'."
    I air quote the word wreck in order to show Meadow that Toma was the one who had said it.
    m "A-Ah... [Pause] Yes, that's him."
    m "Anyway, since all I'm assigned to help you... [Pause] I have also been assigned to take care of him."
    m "But he's a rather stubborn and rude boy! [Pause] I prefer to take care of you rather than him."
    I laughed nervously at Meadow's honesty, finding her dislike for the boy somewhat strange.
    Meadow loves children, especially the little ones. [Pause] For her to not like a boy who looked around my age is rather surprising.
    c "Ah, well maybe he just needs to feel more welcomed in the hospital!" 
    c "Maybe he will be a bit more relaxed-"
    m "Miss Celia, as I told you before, do not go near him."
    I blinked in surprise at Meadow's interruption, her usual caring eyes glazed over with a serious and slightly frightening look.
    I looked down at my lap and nodded slowly.
    c "...Yes, ma'am."
    m "That's a good girl."
    The room went silent aside from the beeping of the heart monitor and the soft ticking of the clock.
    n "Nn? [Pause] Nyu!"
    I looked up at Nyu, who had broken the painful silence between Meadow and I.
    The door opened and closed with a soft click.
    ??? "Good morning."
    m "Oh, good morning Alalia. [Pause] That time already?"
    al "Yes, it is."
    Meadow laughed nervously at my tutor's straight face and stood up, giving Alalia the spot where Meadow was sitting.
    m "Well then, have fun you two."
    c "Don't forget, Nyu!"
    m "Oh, right! [Pause] Have fun you three!"
    n "Nyu~!"
    With a smile, Meadow left the room, leaving Alalia, Nyu, and myself alone.
    a "Why must this creature always be with you even for something as simple as studying?"
    c "Ehehe... Well, Nyu is my emergency care taker."
    c "Besides from Meadow, Nyu must by my side at all times in case something happens. [Pause] So, yes. She does."
    a "I know far well about the creatures' importance to your health." 
    a "But if it stays, it will become a bit of a distraction."
    She declares in a firm manner.
    c "Oh, come on!" 
    c "You have been my tutor for nine years now, and you have dealt with Nyu for the past four years. [Pause] I'm sure that Nyu can not be that distracting to us anymore."
    a "Try telling me that when you pay more attention to me than that creature."
    I giggled nervously at Alalia's cold but honest words, holding Nyu close to my chest.
    This was going to be another interesting day.
    [Transition]
    About an hour or so had passed. [Pause] Alalia was tutoring me as ruthless as ever.
    a "No, no, no. [Pause] X has to be left by itself in order to find out what it stands for."
    a "By putting the seven here, you are doing the opposite.
    c "Ah, so I need to... [Pause] Move the 16 over to this side."
    a "Correct. [Pause] You're getting better at this."
    c "Really?" "Algebra is really hard, I still have a long way to go..."
    Alalia sighed softly, flicking my forehead in slight frustration.
    a "Just take my compliment of your skills."
    c "Ehehe..."
    Patting my forehead, I began to continue solving the difficult math problem.
    Alalia had often praised me when I did something correct, and scolded me when I was wrong, [Pause] but every time she did so, I would have an opposing opinion.
    If I was praised, I would say that I didn't deserve it. [Pause] If I was scolded, I would tell Alalia that she was overlooking something because I had done it right.
    We would always have a disagreement, but it didn't matter in the end. [Pause] As long as I understood the concept.
    Suddenly, a commotion arose from the hallway, the voices of the nurses seeming distressed.
    c "Huh? [Pause] Again?"
    a "Quite the racket their making..."
    Alalia sighed as she continued writing, an uninterested look on her face.
    a "Well, it has nothing to do with our learning. [Pause] Do try not to get involved, Miss Celia."
    I stared at her for a moment, before turning my head towards the door in curiosity.
    This happened yesterday morning as well [Pause] when that boy first arrived...
    Did something happen to him?
