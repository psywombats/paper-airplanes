    I gently bit my lower lip as I stepped away from the door.
    There is no way... [Pause] I-I can't steal someone else's food.
    c "I-I'm sorry... [Pause] I can't get that for you."
    The boy snorted at my response, turned around and began to walk towards me.
    Through the dim lighted room, the boy's green eyes were glazed with an emotion I couldn't fully comprehend.
    It seemed like they were filled with... [Pause] Anger... Guilt... Or perhaps frustration...?
    The boy roughly grabbed my left shoulder and began to push me towards the door.
    Terrified, my voice disappeared and my body stiffened, allowing the boy to easily push my body around.
    The boy pulled the door open and pushed me out of his room, the sound of my body slamming against the marbled floor echoing throughout the desolated hallway.
    I couldn't help but whimper in pain.
    The needle that was once only halfway up a vein in my arm was now fully engulfed into my arm, stabbing my arm.
    I looked up at the boy's door, his green eyes glaring at me through the little window.
    Before vanishing in the dark.
    The boy's room seemed a lot different than when I had first entered.
    It seemed... [Pause] more lonely than before.
    Frozen from the pain of the needle up my arm, I laid there on the sterile, cold floor, waiting for someone to help me.

    [NVL]
    Several days had passed after my encounter with the boy.
    Toma had found me on the ground five minutes after I had been pushed out.
    I couldn't find it in me to tell Toma or Meadow what had happened. [Pause] Even after they had brought my father into the mix.
    "I... [Pause] I just wanted to walk around for a bit, that's all..."
    I would say to the trio every time they had asked.
    "I slipped and fell down. That's how I got the IV needle stuck..."
    That was all I could I say.
    The angry eyes... [Pause] The lonely door... [Pause] It kept all of my words within me.
    I thought that somehow, by keeping quiet... [Pause] I was helping the boy.
    ... But I was wrong.
    Meadow, Toma, and my father all made the decision to keep me securely sealed up in my room.
    No more walks. [Pause] No more lunch at the cafeteria. [Pause] No more visiting the library.
    And by being sealed in my room... [Pause] I couldn't help the boy.
    Day by day, the look of frustration on Meadow's face grew.
    Day by day, the boy refused to eat.
    Until finally... [Pause] He was gone.
    The weakness in his body from not eating had devoured him, leaving his lifeless, cold corpse behind.
    It shouldn't have impacted me... [Pause] But for some, I had felt guilty for his death.
    The nurse who bought the cup of flan could have always bought another. [Pause] They wouldn't have died in anger from having their flan stolen.
    If only I had brought the boy the cup of flan... [Pause] He possibly would still be alive...
    ... [Pause] I'm sorry. It's my fault...
    [Game Over]
