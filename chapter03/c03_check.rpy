    The boy had recently lost an arm... [Pause] And according to Meadow, he was "stubborn" and "rude".
    Perhaps he is trying to escape like he had attempted yesterday?
    I stood up from the small desk that Alalia and I had sat in and rushed towards the door.
    a "Hey, Miss Celia! [Pause] Where do you think you're going? We are in the middle of a lesson!"
    Ignoring Alalia's startled tone, I opened the door just a little bit and stuck my head out the door.
    The nurses' distressed voices had become louder, causing me to look over to the right where the commotion was.
    nurse "Come now, young man. [Pause] You mustn't exit your room like this! You need to stay in bed and get better!"
    There, in the grip of one of the nurses was the boy from yesterday.
    It seems that I was correct and he was trying to escape again.
    boy "..."
    nurse "You're only making this harder on yourself. [Pause] Go back inside, please."
    The nurses were all trying to move the boy back inside his room, and his green eyes glared coldly at them in response.
    Five nurses were all grabbing onto the boy's only arm, trying to drag him back inside. [Pause] But in some miracle, he was able to stand where he was without moving even an inch.
    Why is he trying so hard to escape? [Pause] It can't be that he wants to leave already, can it?
    He had only arrived yesterday, making his injuries fresh and in need of healing.
    If he leaves now, then he'll get an infection! [Pause] Or even worse, his wounds will reopen!
    a "Miss Celia!"
    I gasped at the sudden grip that had grabbed onto my hand, pulling me back from the scene.
    With Alalia's hands tightly gripping my wrist, she closed the door with a stern look directed at me.
    a "We're in the middle of the lesson. [Pause] Save your curiosity for later!"
    Without waiting for a reply, Alalia dragged me toward our table once again and sat me down on my seat.
    With a short sigh, she sat down in her own chair and began to write new problems for me.
    With a nervous smile, I picked up my pencil and began to work.
    I couldn't help but glance towards the door, wondering about what the boy was thinking.
