    [Chapter 4: Hospital Buddies]
    [NVL]
    A few days have passed since my first encounter with the boy.
    According to Meadow, his name is Kenta Clow. [Pause] Age: 14. [Pause] Blood type: O. [Pause] Taurus.
    It has been rather surprising to see Meadow give such information about him.
    At first, she didn't want me to go near Kenta in any way, shape, or form. [Pause] But now, she gives away some details about him.
    It seems as if she has come up with some sort of plan... [Pause] She is always thinking to herself while staring at me.
    Just what could she be thinking...?
    [ADV]
    It's 7:42 in the morning. Birds carelessly chirp on the other side of the large window.
    Petting Nyu's soft fur, I had begun to hum along with the birds' tone.
    But it didn't last very long. [Pause] Moments after I began to hum, the birds stopped chirping and flew off.
    I couldn't help but smile towards the window.
    Despite the birds rude habit of releasing fecal matter wherever they pleased, they truly knew what was considered music.
    m "Excuse me, Miss Celia. May I have a moment?"
    I turned my attention towards the door where Meadow was standing, a smile plastered on her lips.
    c "You need me? What for?"
    m "We're going to pay someone a little visit, that's all."
    I stared at Meadow with a confused look, but obediently slid my legs out from under my blanket and placed the confused Nyu down next to me.
    Meadow walked towards me with a bright smile, quickly taking out a small vial and putting me on mobile mode.
    Once she was finished, we walked out of my room and into the hallway.
    c "Say Meadow, who is it we are going to see?"
    Meadow didn't reply as she continued to walk. The smile never left her face as she kept walking.
    The other nurses inside the station stared at us with a disapproving look.
    Or rather, they stared at Meadow with a disapproving look.
    But Meadow didn't seem to mind, so I decided to follow her example and try to ignore them.
    We walked down the hallway for a bit before Meadow stopped in front of a familiar room.
    The boy Kenta's room. [Pause] 294.
    m "Here we are~!"
    c "...Huh?"
    Meadow opened the door with a mighty pull, making our grand entrance.
    Through the darkness, I saw Kenta remain perfectly still as he gave Meadow an exaggerated glance at the dramatic entrance.
    m "Hello again, Mr. Clow!"
    The boy didn't say a word as he glanced away, causing our eyes to lock.
    k "..."
    c "Ah, um... [Pause] G-Good Morning, Kenta."
    k "...!"
    The boy looked rather surprised at my calling his name. [Pause] Perhaps it was too forward?
    I felt myself flush with embarrassment as I smiled shyly to him, debating whether or not to call him "Kenta" or "Mr. Clow" like Meadow did.
    Meadow gently grabbed my right wrist, closed the door, and then dragged me closer to Kenta's bed.
    m "Alright, listen up! [Pause] I have something big to tell you two!"
    Meadow let go of my wrist as she pulled me to stand in front of Kenta's bed, right next to him. She placed both of her hands on her hips in a proud way.
    m "I talked it over with the director, and he has agreed to allow the two of you to be hospital buddies!"
    k "...?"
    c "Hospital buddies?"
    m "Yes, hospital buddies! [Pause] You two are now in charge of taking care of each other!"
    k "?!"
    I was flabbergasted by Meadow's announcement; all I could do was stand there and repeat the words in my head.
    Hospital buddies... [Pause] Hospital buddies... [Pause] Hospital... Buddies...
    m "Isn't this great, Miss Celia? [Pause] Now you have someone to talk with every day~!"
    c "Ah, um... [Pause] I suppose, but why are we "hospital buddies" all of a sudden?"
    m "Isn't it obvious? [Pause] Mister I-glare-at-people-so-they-stay-away-from-me must have been impacted by you in some way to have eaten his food."
    m "Most kids eat immediately after I tell them to, but he didn't until you visited him. [Pause] So, in order to get rid of his current attitude, you need to take care of him!"
    c "Ah, well... [Pause] He is still in the early stages of recovering, so perhaps it just so happened that on the same day I visited him, his appetite returned."
    m "Hahah! [Pause] There's no way that's possible!"
    I stared at Meadow in disbelief at her illogical behavior, wondering what had gotten into her all of a sudden.
    Meadow's laughter echoed throughout the dark room. Simultaneously, I noticed that Kenta had gotten out of bed and was staggering his way towards the door.
    I stared at him as he struggled to walk properly, thinking about the situation Meadow had practically thrown us in.
    I would be lying to myself if I told myself that I didn't want to be Hospital Buddies with him.
    Kenta is the same age as me, and by being hospital buddies, I could talk to someone other than Nyu, Alalia, and Meadow.
    And being in a hospital for my entire life, I didn't really have any friends my own age. [Pause] Even Toma is older than me by two years. 
    It would... [Pause] It would be rather nice to have a friend.
    A real friend.
    I smiled slightly at the idea, being friends with someone my own age...
    A loud smack brought me back to reality, and I covered my mouth simultaneously.
    m "Hey, get back on your bed."
    Kenta, who was tightly captured by Meadow's grip, rubbed the back of his head in pain as he wobbled back to the bed.
    m "This is for your own recovery, Mr. Clow." 
    m "I suggest you drop that attitude of yours. [Pause] If Miss Celia becomes upset over you, I'll have another hand to slap some sense into you."
    c "M-Meadow! [Pause] You can't hit a patient!"
    m "I can if they're younger than me and being a brat."
    c "No, you still can't do that!"
    Meadow merely shrugged as she let go of Kenta's shoulders, taking a few step backs.
    m "Well, I have to head off somewhere now."
    m "You two behave and... [Pause] Keep the door open."
    Meadow flashed a bright smile towards us before she turned around and left, leaving Kenta and I alone in the darkness.
    c "Ah, um, I'm sorry about Meadow. [Pause] Are you alright?"
    k "..."
    Kenta nodded slowly as he continued to rub the back of his head, no signs of pain on his face.
    c "I'm sorry that Meadow forced you into this..."
    Kenta glanced at me as he sat down on his bed, not saying anything.
    Aside from Kenta's heart monitor, we were blanketed in the silence that filled the dark room.
    It felt strange and out of place for me to begin speaking, so I decided to let me eyes wander the room.
    My eyes soon fell upon an empty tray that once held food.
    c "Hey, you ate your food today! [Pause] Good for you."
    k "!"
    Kenta's face reddened and looked away, snorting in response.
    I smiled at Kenta, glad that he had taken my words of wisdom seriously.
    c "Ah, um... [Pause] If it's alright with you, may I ask you a few things?"
    k "..."
    With his usual silent response, I slowly sat down on the visitors chair that was bathed in the light coming from the door.
    What question should I ask...?
