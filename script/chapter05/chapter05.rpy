    [Chapter 5: Paper Flower]
    [NVL format]
    The same darkness engulfed me inside of the hospital room, blocking the bright spring sunlight.
    I stared at the heavy white curtains that covered the window next to the bed.
    White...
    Despite the darkness of the room, I was still able to see the pure white color of the curtains...
    I looked down at my lap at the sketchbook and pencil the girl had given me yesterday.
    Just like the curtains, the sketchbook and the pencil were both white.
    ... [Pause] I felt something familiar grow in me the more I stared at the objects.
    I could never admit this to anyone... [Pause] But I was rather glad to receive the sketchbook.
    I love writing... [Pause] I don't use such empty words that most people use when speaking.
    When I write... [Pause] I can express myself without hurting anyone.
    ... [Pause] I wonder if that girl is coming again today.
    It was only yesterday that we were announced to be "hospital buddies" by that nurse.
    I scrunched my face in slight frustration at the memory of the nurse, causing me rub the back of my head.
    That bitch hit me pretty hard. [Pause] My head still hurts. [Pause] Or maybe I grew that weak?
    I sighed silently as I stopped rubbing my head.
    I looked over to the door, where small rays of light entered the room through the window.
    ... [Pause] For some reason, I think that the girl will come.
    ... [Pause] Hm?
    Wow, this is a first. [Pause] I'm surprised just how comfortable I am with this whole situation.
    Celia was her name... [Pause] Pretty.
    My relaxed body suddenly tensed as I glared at the door.
    I quickly grabbed the sketchbook and pencil Celia gave me, putting them underneath the blanket.
    The door opened and closed, a long shadow forming before disappearing halfway.
    It was that nurse again.
    [ADV formant]
    nurse "Good morning, Mr. Clow."
    The sounds of high heels tapping as they made contact with the ceramic floor crept into my ear, causing me to tense up even more.
    Something was suddenly placed on my lap, and I flinched and turned my attention towards the nurse.
    nurse "Sheesh, so jumpy! [Pause] At least your reflexes are good."
    I glanced over to my lap, a tray of food catching my attention, causing me to relax slightly.
    nurse "So, are you finally going to eat while I'm here? [Pause] Or are you going to continue to be a stubborn mule?"
    k "..."
    nurse "..."
    k "..."
    The nurse sighed in quick defeat, grabbing a clipboard above my head and turning her attention towards the beeping box.
    Hesitantly, I glanced over to the tray of food.
    It was the same meal that the nurse always brought in.
    Eggs, rice, a bowl filled with some sort of flat bread covered in some sticky sweet stuff, milk, and three pills of medication.
    I stared at the medication in dissatisfaction. [Pause] It didn't really help me...
    nurse "So, tell me. [Pause] How is your arm doing?"
    k "..."
    My arm is fine, but my head still hurts. Thanks for asking!
    nurse "Any pain at all? [Pause] Is it numb, does it hurt to be positioned a certain way?"
    k "..."
    Well, the back of my head was throbbing for a total of fifteen minutes before Artil came and started punching me.
    Once again, thanks for asking about my head. [Pause] It's, you know, only the most important part of the body.
    nurse "... [Pause] I'm getting some real sassy vibes off you..."
    k "..."
    Congratulations, you can read vibes. [Pause] Will you take a hint and ask how my head is doing, you stupid bitch?
    The nurse sighed in exhaustion, placing the clipboard back where it used to hang above my head.
    nurse "Fine, if you don't want to talk to me that's fine. [Pause] Just talk to Celia about it, alright? I need to know how the medication is doing."
    The nurse turned around and walked out of the room, leaving me and the darkness to ourselves once again.
    I looked over to the food the nurse had left me.
    ... [Pause] The first step to recovery...
    Slowly, I grabbed a spoon and began to eat the rice with eggs.
    
    [Transition]
    It was 11:30 in the morning, the darkness still covering my room.
    Time moves by so quickly in here. [Pause] It seemed as if it was just two minutes ago that the stupid nurse had gone and taken my half-eaten food away from me.
    She seemed rather satisfied at the amount I ate, even though I didn't eat everything.
    Slapping me one day and happily praising me for how much I ate the next... [Pause] What a weirdo.
    With no light to draw or write, I lay on the bed while staring out of the door window... Waiting patiently for Celia to arrive.
    ... [Pause] Short blond hair, blue eyes, shiny skin, really soft girly voice, and the director's daughter as well. [Pause] It was very interesting.
    That's all I know about this "Celia Creed".
    As I continued to stare out the door window, a strange creature suddenly popped up from the other side.
    k "?!"
    Startled, I sat up quickly, causing my left shoulder to throb. 
    I gripped my shoulder, pressing my lips together to hold in a scream of pain that I knew would never come anyway.
    creature "Nyu!"
    k "?!?!"
    Without me even noticing the door opening, the strange creature flew in and stared at me.
    k "..."
    creature "Nyu... Nyu?"
    k "..."
    ??? "Ah, oh no! [Pause] Nyu, don't do that!"
    I turned my attention towards the door, where Celia rushed into the room with a panicked expression.
    c "I-I'm sorry, Kenta!"
    Celia grabbed the strange creature away from me, cradling it in her arms.
    creature "Nyu!"
    Removing the sketchbook and pencil from underneath the cloth, I wrote down a question.
    k "\"What is that creature?\""
    c "Hm? [Pause] Oh, this is Nyu! She's my emergency caretaker."
    c "Since we became hospital buddies, I-I thought that you should meet her too!"
    k "... [Pause] "\"I see.\""
    k "... [Pause] "\"Well then, WHAT is she?\""
    c "Hmm, well..."
    Celia thought for a moment as she looked down at "Nyu" in her arms.
    c "Nyu is... [Pause] Nyu is a \"bulakka\", or at least that is what her creator calls her. She can shape-shift into people and things if she wanted to, isn't that neat?"
    c "I got Nyu around four years ago from my father!"
    "Father," huh... [Pause] Mr. Creed, the director.
    He didn't look like the "good father" type, not with those lifeless eyes.
    I suppose I can't read everyone.
    I stared at the strange creature, my image reflected in its eyes.
    ... [Pause] It's cute.
    c "Ah, um... [Pause] How is your arm doing?"
    k "..."
    Strange that she would ask that question now... [Pause] Did that nurse tell her to ask me?
    The bitch did tell me to talk to Celia about it.
    k "..."
    
    menu:
        "Be honest":
            k "..."
            k "\"The medicine makes my shoulder go numb.\""
            k "\"And with the lotion stuff, I become itchy.\""
            c "I see... [Pause] I'm sorry about that."
            ... [Pause] Celia apologizes too much.
            c "I'll tell Meadow about it later, alright?"
            k "\"Thanks.\""
            Celia smiled. Her expression practically brightened up the room.
            I blushed at her smile, causing me to look away to hide the shade of red from my face.

        "Lie":
            k "..."
            k "\"It's fine.\""
            c "Oh, are you sure?"
            I nodded in reply.
            Celia pouted slightly, not buying my fake answer.
            c "Hm... [Pause] Well, if you're sure then..."
            k "\"I'm fine, honest.\""
            c "... [Pause] Alright."
            Celia smiled. her expression practically brightened up the room.
            I blushed at her smile, causing me to look away to hide the shade of red from my face.
            Now I feel guilty for lying. [Pause] Especially when her smile is so bright like that...

    I heard a squeaking sound of metal where Celia was. [Pause] She must have taken a seat on that strange chair.
    A somewhat comfortable silence filled the air, and my blush slowly faded away.
    c "Um... Kenta?"
    I glanced over to Celia, noting her gaze was directed towards my lap.
    c "Ah, sorry! [Pause] I-I just... Visiting someone in a hospital deserves some sort of gift, and well... May I please have one?"
    c "Um, a piece of paper."
    k "...?"
    I stared at the now-embarrassed Celia, trying to figure out her motives.
    Under my gaze, Celia's eyes wander the room, a soft blush forming on her cheeks.
    ... [Pause] Cute.
    Looking down at the sketchbook, I carefully ripped a single sheet of paper along the spiral binding, making the paper clean.
    c "Th-Thank you!"
    Celia happily took the paper from my hands, the strange creature climbing up her shoulder to her head.
    I watched Celia as she began to gently fold the piece of paper.
    ... [Pause] I couldn't understand it.
    The question Artil asked yesterday dwelled in my mind as I watched Celia fold happily.
    Just why... [Pause] Why would a girl like Celia visit me?
    Me, of all people? [Pause] I even glared at her as I usually did with other when we first met...
    So why?
    I'm dead anyway... [Pause] Why did she agree to this "hospital buddies" situation?
    That nurse would have listened to her if she had denied the offer...
    So... [Pause] Why?
    More and more questions piled in my mind as I continued to stare at the happy, innocent Celia.
    [Transition]
    c "And... [Pause] Done!"
    I raised my eyebrows in slight surprise and amusement, and I felt a little excited to see the ten minute creation.
    Celia stood up from her seat and gave me her creation.
    It was an elegant paper flower. [Pause] A "lobtus", I believe.
    k "..."
    c "It's a paper lobtus! [Pause] I read in a book that lobtus flowers mean \"purity\" in Labindala."
    c "But it can also mean \"rebirth\" in Ionism."
    c "Hehe, if you think about it... [Pause] It would mean \"pure rebirth\" when put together."
    "Pure Rebirth"...
    How nice.
    k "..."
    c "...Hm?"
    c "Could it be? [Pause] Do you like flowers, Kenta?"
    k "!"
    k "..."
    k "\"You could say that.\""
    Celia giggled as my blush continued to reddened. Even when I tried to bring myself together, nothing seemed to work.
    c "Well, in that case... [Pause] let's decorate your entire room with lobtus flowers!"
    k "?!"
    Celia smiled brightly, turned around, and practically began to run towards the door.
    c "I have some colored pencils in my room! [Pause] I'll get some as well as some paper!"
    I stared at the open door, where I saw several nurses from the nurses' station stare in the direction Celia went.
    ... [Pause] Celia is pretty childish, huh?
    ... [Pause] Cute.
    
    [Transition]
    Sitting in the silent dark room, I made the finishing folds to the lobtus flower in my hands.
    Shortly after getting a ridiculous amount of paper as well as a box of colored pencils, Celia taught me how to make the paper lobtus flowers.
    ... [Pause] Finished.
    I raised the paper lobtus flower towards the light from the doorway.
    k "..."
    A bright blue, pink, and green lobtus flower.
    A nice combination. [Pause] Almost looks like the real deal.
    n "Nyu!"
    I looked over to Nyu, who was sitting next to me.
    I showed her the lobtus flower, which she sniffed as her ears twitched.
    n "Nyu nyu!"
    k "..."
    I turned my attention over to Celia, feeling a sudden jolt from her.
    c "..."
    A little while ago, Celia had fallen asleep while coloring her seventh lobtus flower purple.
    Her delicate eyelids covering her blue orbs, her short blond hair resting on her shoulders...
    ...I suppose it was the dim light from the hallway, but her hair seemed to have lit up the entire room.
    It is the opposite of mine... [Pause] Blond and bright, like the sun.
    It certainly complements her smiley personality.
    n "Nyu..."
    Sighing, Nyu's ears enlarged, which caused me to blink in surprise.
    Nyu's ears began to flap rapidly, but silently, and she flew towards the door, leaving Celia and I alone.
    ... [Pause] Where would a creature like Nyu need to go?
    ... [Pause] The bathroom?
    c "Ha... [Pause] More flan, please..."
    k "..."
    Huh, so she's the type of girl who talks in her sleep?
    k "..."
    ... [Pause] She reminds me of Artil, in a way.
    I stared at the sleeping girl next to me, the drool slowly trailing down her lips.
    Hesitantly, I grabbed the coloring pencil and lobtus flower from her, not wanting them to get wet with drool.
    Slowly... [Pause] Slowly... [Pause] Got it.
    ... [Pause] Did I get drool on my fingers?
    ... [Pause] No, I'm good.
    I stared at the half finished purple lobtus, holding it up towards the light like I had done earlier.
    The colors of purple and white... [Pause] Plain on the outside, but colorful on the inside.
    ... [Pause] Sort of like them...
    My face darkened at the thought of that person. [Pause] My hand holding the paper lobtus slowly descended to my lap.
    Even though I had left my past behind, they still have me wrapped around their finger.
    k "..."
    I can't blame them... [Pause] They were a part of my family after all.
    It's hard to forget about your family... [Pause] Even when they're no more.
    ??? "Whoa geez! [Pause] Why is it so dark in here?"
    My body tenses as I sharply turn my head towards the door, a figure with Nyu on top of their head looking around the room.
    The man's eyes widened slightly at the sight of my missing arm, squinting through the darkness.
    My eyes are up here, asshole.
    As if he had heard me, his eyes went up slowly, looking for my face.
    
    if $c03_kenta_interesting:
        Once our eyes finally locked for a brief moment, a bright smile suddenly formed on the stranger's face.
        man "Hey, you must be the new guy! [Pause] Erm, Kenta Clow right?"
        k "..."
        Hesitantly, I give a short nod.
        man "..."
        man "Heh, you really are quiet! [Pause] The name's Toma by the way. Toma Brith."
        k "..."
        n "Nyu!"
        Nyu, catching my attention, flew from the man's head and towards Celia, landing beside her.
        man "Hm? [Pause] Oh, so that's why you brought me here."
        The man named "Toma" looked at Celia and me, his face straight and hard to read.
        man "Aw, aren't the two of you cute? [Pause] All the making flowers and holding hands and stuff."
        k "?!"
        I looked down at my hand, seeing if it was holding one of Celia's.
        It wasn't.
        I looked up at the man, who was now laughing, and shot him a glare.
        man "Ahaha, your face is pretty red! [Pause] Can't believe you fell for it."
        I shot another glare at him, which only caused him to laugh a little more.
        n "Nyu...!"
        man "Ah, right right. [Pause] Sorry!"
        Still chuckling, the man walked towards Celia, Nyu, and I, causing me to tense.
        He stopped right behind Celia, careful placing his hands on her back and somewhere below her knees.
        Tensing up, my hand tightened up as if wanting to slap the man's hands off of Celia. [Pause] But I kept it steady, since doing that would probably wake up Celia.
        Easily lifting Celia's body up in a strange way, the man flashed a smile at me.
        man "I'm going to go and get this fool out of your way."
        The man's whispering voice somehow tickled me, making me feel a bit more relaxed.
        man "You're recovering from that, right? [Pause] You go and get some sleep too."
        man "It's unhealthy to overwork yourself after an incident."
        k "..."
        The man smiled at me one last time, as Nyu hopped on top of his head before he turned around and carefully walked towards the door.
        Soon, the three of them were gone. [Pause] I was alone in the usual darkness with the paper lobtus flowers.
        k "..." 
        ... [Pause] Why am I upset about that "Toma" guy?
        Why am I even upset at all?
        
    if $c03_kenta_strange:
        Our eyes locked briefly, when suddenly his face darkened.
        man "..."
        k "..."
        The silence was rather tense, as if the air was filled with toxic gasses and just a single whiff would cause a fight.
        man "... [Pause] You must be Mr. Clow."
        k "..."
        The silence quickly returned, our eyes still locked.
        ??? "Nyu!"
        k "...?"
        Looking up at the top at the stranger's head, I saw Nyu.
        Her ears enlarged like earlier before she swooped down, landing next to the sleeping Celia.
        man "...Hm?"
        The stranger's attention turned towards Nyu, his eyes widening at the sight of Celia.
        His face darkened once again as he swiftly headed towards Celia, Nyu, and I.
        My body tensed as he stopped behind Celia, his eyes focused on her sleeping figure.
        His hands reached out to her, causing me to jolt.
        man "!"
        k "..."
        man "... [Pause] Let go."
        k "..."
        man "Let go. [Pause] I'm taking her back to her room."
        My grip tightened, not believing the stranger.
        n "Nyu!"
        I glanced over to Nyu, her ears drooping down while her little paws reached out to me.
        n "Nyu! [Pause] Nyu nyu, nyui!"
        k "..."
        I stared into Nyu's large eyes, an image of fear mixed in them.
        k "..."
        Despite the fact that I couldn't understand her, I could tell that she was scared and wanted me to let go.
        k "..."
        Reluctantly, I let go of the stranger's hand, turning my attention towards the window.
        man "Ow... [Pause] Strong grip you got there."
        I ignored the stranger and continued to stare at the windows as I felt Celia's weight, slowly lift off the bed.
        I shot a glance over to the door.
        The stranger was carrying Celia in a strange way, her legs visible to me, as Nyu hopped on top of the stranger's head.
        Soon, the three of them were gone. [Pause] I was alone in the usual darkness with the paper lobtus flowers.
        k "..." 
        ... [Pause] Why was that guy so upset with me? What was his problem?
        How did he know me, and why was he the one to return Celia to her room?
        ...Hm?
        Wait [Pause] why am I upset about all of this?
        The image of the stranger holding Celia in his arms flashed into my mind, causing greater confusion within myself.

    ... [Pause] This makes no sense. [Pause] Maybe I'm tired.
    With a silent grunt, I moved the paper flowers to the right side of the bed, tucked myself underneath the cloth, and lay down.
    Event with the annoying beeping of the strange machine, my eyes fluttered closed, taking me to a dream world.
