    [Transition]
    After another two hours of studying with Alalia, we finished our lessons for the day.
    The commotion had simmered down after ten minutes.
    Lunch time had arrived, and with Alalia gone, Nyu and I were left to entertain ourselves while waiting for our meals.
    I was sketching Nyu as always, while she waited with anticipation.
    c "Hm... [Pause] My drawings aren't that bad, right Nyu?"
    n "Nn?"
    c "Well, with what Toma said... [Pause] About my drawings being horrible... [Pause] He was just teasing me, right?"
    n "Nyu..."
    c "Huh? [Pause] Hey, what's with that tone? Am I really that bad?"
    n "Nyui!"
    I puffed out my cheeks in slight frustration as I looked down at my sketch.
    It can't be that bad. [Pause] My skills have certainly improved over the years!
    The door opened, catching my attention as the smell of food wafted my way.
    m "Room service!"
    n "Nyu!"
    Nyu's ears enlarged and she flew towards Meadow, scanning the tray of food for her portion.
    Meadow quickly walked towards me and placed the tray of food on my lap, causing the contents to jiggle a bit at the movement.
    The tray has consisted of a bowl filled with thick noodles and pieces of chicken sitting in a steamy broth, a small plate of lettuce and greens, a piece of dried beef, and a small cup of lukewarm water.
    Nyu quickly swooped down and swiped the piece of dried beef, happily chewing on it before she could even land on the bed next to me.
    n "Nyu~!"
    c "Thank you for the meal!"
    c "Ah, actually!"
    c "Meadow, can you take a look at this?"
    m "Hm?"
    Meadow, who had already began to write down the heart monitor number turned in my direction as I pulled out the piece of paper with the drawing of Nyu on it.
    c "Meadow, do you think this is okay?"
    m "Huh?" 
    m "Um, well... [Pause] It's Nyu right?"
    c "Yes, it is!"
    m "Hm..." 
    m "It's certainly not bad, but... [Pause] It doesn't really look like her."
    c "Huh?!"
    c "Really? [Pause] It doesn't look like her at all?"
    m "A-Ah, well...! [Pause] I was certainly able to tell that it was Nyu, so that's something!"
    I puffed out my left cheek as I stared at the drawing.
    It looks just like Nyu!
    The kind look in the eyes... [Pause] The little button nose that screams curiosity...
    The fluffy fur that invites anyone to touch... [Pause] Why can't people see that it's almost a replica of Nyu?
    m "Hey, hey... [Pause] Come on now, it's not all that bad! It looks pretty good, you just need some more practice."
    c "Mm... [Pause] I suppose..."
    m "There you go, that's the spirit!"
    m "Oh no! [Pause] The food!"
    Meadow suddenly turned around and rushed out the door, leaving the door open and myself in a confused state.
    Perhaps she was going to feed the boy?
    I smiled a little at the thought, glad that she hadn't given up on him.
    c "Nyu, please close the door for me."
    n "Nyumph!"
    Nyu, still happily eating her dried beef, flew towards the door and gently closed it as I had asked.
    I turned my attention to my food, grabbed a spoon and began to eat.
    [Transition]
    Once half of my meal was finished, Meadow returned with a defeated and rather frustrated look on her face.
    c "Welcome back. [Pause] How is the boy doing?"
    m "Humph! [Pause] Still rather stubborn. I don't know what to do with him."
    I smiled nervously at Meadow's response, placing my fork down.
    c "Well, he was rather recently in an incident. [Pause] Perhaps he was damaged in some way that caused him to have a different appetite."
    m "I don't really think it works like that." 
    m "It would make more sense if he became very attached to someone. [Pause] That would be a sign of post traumatic disorder."
    c "That's true..."
    c "... [Pause] Meadow, I know you've said no, but may I go and welcome him to the hospital now?"
    m "Absolutely not! [Pause] It doesn't matter how many times you ask me Miss Celia, I will have to say no."
    c "But why? [Pause] He must be really scared about being in this hospital. I've seen him try to escape his room twice already!"
    m "Miss Celia, you cannot go anywhere near him because your - !"
    Meadow abruptly cut herself off, causing the room to return to its usual beeping and ticking state.
    I stared at Meadow in confusion as she began to look away from me.
    m "... [Pause] I was instructed to make sure that you did not go near him, Miss Celia."
    m "And you should know better than anyone that I go by the rules."
    Meadow didn't say a word after that, turning her attention towards the clipboard on which she had yet to finish writing the complicated numbers of the heart monitor.
    I had become too nervous to say anything, the atmosphere eating my words every time I opened my mouth to try to say something.
    Even Nyu had began to become uncomfortable with the atmosphere, staring at me as she slowly chewed on her almost gone beef.
    For some reason... [Pause] Meadow looked sad as she scribbled down the monitor numbers.
    The sentence that she couldn't finish... [Pause] No, more like didn't want to finish, seemed to have been dwelling in her mind.
    She was going to say something that involved me... [Pause] But no matter how hard I tried to think about what Meadow wanted to say, I couldn't make the connection.
    Once my meal was finished, Meadow took my tray and left the room, not saying a word as she left.
    What did she want to say, I wonder...
    n "..."
    c "Hm... On another note, what should I do about the boy?"
    He was clearly causing trouble for Meadow, and it seems that he wants to escape from here.
    If only I could welcome him to the hospital... [Pause] I'm sure that he'll feel a bit more comfortable here if I do...
    c "Hm... What to do, what to do..." 
    c "What do you think, Nyu? [Pause] Should I just go and greet him?"
    n "Nyu!"
    c "Hehe! [Pause] You think I should as well, huh?"
    c "Alright! [Pause] It's decided then! I'm going to go and welcome the boy!"
    n "Nyu!"
    c "..."
    n "..."
    c "..." 
    c "... [Pause] Although... Meadow would be rather upset at me if I do..."
    n "Nyu...!"
    n "Nyu nyu nyu! Nyu nyu, nyui!"
    c "You're right! [Pause] I can't back down now!"
    c "The boy won't get better if he's afraid of this place!"
    With a confident deep breath, I slid my legs out from under my blanket and stood up.
    c "Alright! [Pause] First things first, I need to fill up the vial!"
    n "Nyu!"
    Nyu flew over my head and towards the cabinets next to the bookshelves, where a spare vial was stored.
    Toma is the one who has the vial with him at all times, seeing as how the two of us walk around together.
    n "Nyu, nyui!"
    Nyu flew towards me with a clean empty needle and vial at hand.
    I placed my hands next to each other as a landing platform for Nyu, into which she gently placed the vial.
    Nyu flew towards the IV stand and with the needle, began to extract the fluid inside.
    Once the needle was filled up to 15 milliliters of fluid, Nyu handed my the needle and I inserted the fluid inside the vial, hooking up the IV needles to it shortly after.
    I smiled and returned the needle to Nyu, who was resting on the bed.
    c "Alright, I'm off!"
    n "Nyu!"
    I petted Nyu's head twice before turning around and heading towards the door.
    Peeking out of the door window, I saw that the den known as the nurses' station was empty. [Pause] No wolves known as nurses in sight.
    It was around 1:30, so it was lunch break for all the nurses in the west wing.
    It was the perfect opportunity to go and welcome the boy.
    Gripping the vial, I opened the door and stepped outside of my room, the door gently closing behind me.
    My heartbeat began to quicken a little bit at my actions, but I quickly calmed it down as I began to walk towards the boys room.
    Room 294... [Pause] Although I had never seen the number plate of the boy's residence room, I knew that it had to be this one.
    Room 294 hasn't seen a new patient for two years, after the previous resident had died of heart failure.
    Swallowing the saliva that had formed in my mouth from nervousness, I peeked inside the room through the small window.
    It was dark and rather hard to see inside... [Pause] Why weren't the lights on?
    Perhaps the lights burned out...? [Pause] No, that wouldn't make any sense.
    Shaking aside my curious thoughts about the lights, I stood up straight and gently knocked on the door.
    Counting to ten, I sighed to reassure myself and slowly opened the door.
    Taking a step inside the room, I noticed how much darker the room was than it looked, the only source of light coming from the slightly open door that only reached the edge of the bed.
    With the limited light, I squinted in the dark, making out figures when my eyes met a pair of dangerous green ones.
    boy "..."
    c "Ah!"
    The boy's tense and dangerous eyes caught me off guard, causing myself to straighten up.
    c "I-I'm sorry! [Pause] I-I let myself in after knocking on your door! I should have waited for you to say something! I-I'm sorry for intruding!"
    boy "...?"
    The boy began to relax, his once dangerous eyes slowly turning into curious ones.
    c "Ah... Um..."
    c "My name is Celia... [Pause] Celia Creed."
    boy "...!"
    I blinked a few times to help me adjust to the darkness, allowing me to see the outline of the boy's dark hair.
    His hair was so dark, I couldn't even see it earlier. [Pause] It looked as if the darkness was eating a part of his face.
    c "Um, I-I just wanted to welcome you to the hospital!"
    c "I heard that you were in an accident before you arrived here, and that's how you lost your arm... [Pause] I'm sorry that it happened to you."
    c "But, don't worry! [Pause] Everyone here will take good care of you and everything will be okay!"
    boy "..."
    The boy snorted softly as his eyes softened, and he turned his head towards the curtained window next to him.
    I fell silent at his actions, looking down at my feet as I thought about what to say.
    To him, I'm just a stranger who had rudely entered his room without permission.
    That won't make him feel at home here...
    c "Um... [Pause] Oh!"
    c "I-If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to visit room 302! [Pause] That's my room!"
    The boy did nothing as he continued to stare at the curtains.
    I fell silent at this, curious as to why he didn't open them.
    The room is so dark, it's really hard to see. [Pause] So why doesn't he open the curtains?
    I pressed my lips together as I began to glance around the room, feeling immobile for some reason.
    c "...Hm?"
    My wondering eyes stopped as I noticed a tray of food sitting on the ground, in front of the bed.
    I walked towards the tray, my eyes locked on it - trying to make out every single detail through the darkness.
    c "Hey... [Pause] Did you not eat your lunch? It's sitting here, in front of your bed."
    I knelt down in front of the food to take a better look.
    The food on the plate consisted of a small portion of rice that had grown cold, a bowl of vegetables and meat, and a cup of warm water that sat in front of three small pills.
    The food looked as if it was just delivered to him, but the cold air that drifted off from it told a different story.
    I looked over to the boy, who was staring at me with nervous eyes, and waited for a reply.
    After a moment of silence, the boy glanced away from me and slowly nodded.
    c "Unacceptable!"
    boy "?!"
    The boy jolted from my sudden action, his eyes wide with slight surprise and shock.
    c "Don't you understand how important food is? [Pause] It is the most important step in recovering!"
    c "You didn't even take your medication! [Pause] Why didn't you eat it?"
    boy "..."
    c "..."
    c "Ah!"
    c "Could it be that you didn't like it?"
    boy "..."
    The boy said nothing, but I could tell that I was somewhere close to the reason as to why he didn't eat.
    c "Well, if that is the case, then I will go and get whatever kind of food you want!"
    The boy turned towards me, eyes wide at my announcement.
    I smiled confidently at him, tying my hands behind my back as I awaited his request.
    After a moment of silence, the boy slid his legs out from under his bed and began to clumsily stagger towards the door.
    c "Ah! [Pause] W-Wait, I said that I would get it for you!"
    The boy stopped in front of the door and looked at me, gesturing with his head for me to approach him.
    Obediently I did so, stopping right next to him.
    Standing side by side like this, I noticed that the boy had a rather good complexion and was at least five or so inches taller than me.
    The boy suddenly pointed out somewhere, causing me to follow his finger.
    My eyes locked at the cup of flan that sat on top of nurses station, that was still empty.
    c "Is that what you want to eat?"
    The boy nodded in reply.
    I looked back over to the cup of flan and pressed my lips together.
    What should I do? [Pause] That flan belongs to one of the nurses and is most certainly something that they are looking forward to eating... 
    But if I don't get it for the boy, then he won't recover. [Pause] And after the flan incident that Toma and I caused, it's not like I can buy a cup of flan at the cafeteria.
    Should I get it for him anyway...?
