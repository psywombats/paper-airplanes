    I'm a little curious about what's happening downstairs...
    I don't think it would hurt to go and see what is going on.
    After a good solid three minutes of debating with myself, I mustered up as much courage as I could and moved my breakfast tray to the side. 
    With a deep breath, I slid out from my blanket, letting my feet hit the ground.
    n "Nyu!"
    I looked over to Nyu, who was giving me quite the stern look from her glossy eyes.
    c "I'm just a little curious Nyu. I won't be gone for too long, alright?"
    n "Nyu..."
    I gave her a quick reassuring smile as I unhooked my bag of IV and carried it gently in my arms.
    Usually, I would go \"mobile\" by putting my IV into a small vial, but I didn’t want to waste any time.
    Leaving Nyu by her lonesome, I walked over to the door and hesitantly opened it.
    If I had to be honest with myself... {w=3.0} I was a little nervous.
    Many people come to this hospital for a variety of different purposes, ranging from casual checks ups to drastic emergencies.
    If I head down there, I might see something horrible...
    A broken leg...
    A dislocated shoulder...
    Or maybe even a black eye...
    ...Or blood.
    A cold shiver of fear ran up and down my spine at the thought of what I might see.
    I shook my head, pushing the negative and fearful thoughts out.
    I will only be there for a moment, take a glance of the situation, and then leave before anyone can notice me.
    With a confident nod, I took a proud step out of my room.
    I looked down the hallway before taking another step, noticing that the nurse’s station not to far from my room is rather empty.
    Using this to my advantage, I stealthily ran towards the elevator. 
    It would be a lot more troublesome to take the stairs.
    The other doctors and nurses would have a higher chance of noticing me if I took the stairs, and they would instantly notice me thanks to the incident four years ago.
    Once I reached the elevator, I quickly pressed the button five times in desperation while looking both to the left and right, making sure not to get myself caught..
    I took a step back and impatiently waited for the elevator. 
    As I waited, I suddenly heard two low voices - most likely two men - shouting. 
    Their voices were mixed with the rapid sounds of stomping footsteps.
    I gasped softly in worry, trying to find a place to hide.
    mans_voice "Did... see... poor kid?!"
    I froze in place at one of the voice's words. 
    A child... Could this be about the noise downstairs?
    What happened? {w=2.0} Why does the man sound like he is in such a panic?
    Because of how loud their footsteps were, I couldn't hear everything they were saying.
    other_man "His entire... blown off! This... is getting... hand!"
    \"Blown off?\" {w=4.0} Something from that child was blown off?
    Why? {w=2.0} And by what?
    Wha... What is going on beyond the walls of the hospital...?!
    mans_voice "We need to... Silver... there!"
    other_man "You're right, there... much blood...!!"
    What...? {w=1.0} Blood...?
    Suddenly, my heart began to pound as if trying to escape my body and run far away from the frightening words.
    c "..."
    c "...Ngh..."
    My body became tight; I found myself frozen in place.
    My eyes strained to stay open as I stood there, motionless aside from my throbbing heart. 
    Something isn't right.
    The panicked voices of the men started to blend with their footsteps, fading away into an abyss, where I couldn't hear anything.
    My chest... hurts...! {w=1.0} I-I'm scared...
    What's going on?
    My knee trembled, ready to lose their strength as my heartbeat rang in my ears like the lasting notes from a base drum.
    Each breath I took stabbed my body; waves of pain flowed through my body endlessly.
    It hurts... {w=4.0} So much...
    Slowly, my blood began to turn cold... 
    My heartbeat stopped as a momentous sound rung in my ears.
    My legs now felt numb as I let out a soft sigh.
    My eyelids suddenly became heavy, closing against my will and blocking me out of the vivid world I was in only moments ago...
    The next thing I knew, everything became still...
