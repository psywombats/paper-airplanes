    Somewhere in the vast world of Mion, above where Ion sleeps, there is a meadow.
    The meadow has a secret that only those with the curse may know. {w=4.0} Not even the dark lord who watches over them, Kxon, knows where this meadow lies.
    The meadow is surrounded by tall, healthy, and green alder trees beneath a bright blue sky, creating a peaceful tranquility.
    It is a meadow filled with flowers that virtually cover the green grass. {w=4.0} The lovely flowers vary from yellow carnations, cosmos, irises, jasmines, lilies, orchids, to white roses.
    In this meadow, flower petals dance elegantly in the gentle spring breeze, never learning of the cold and harsh touch of winter.
    The tall alder trees protect the flowers at their base from the small drops of rain, causing the green grass to shine in the dew of the water.
    Amidst this beauteous scenery, {w=2.0} there is a young mother and her daughter, calmly making flower crowns while listening to the soothing lullabies from the wind.
    The mother has long beautiful blond hair that could light up the night sky, complemented with a pair of zircon colored eyes.
    The daughter is a spitting image of her.
    "\"Tell me, dear...\""
    ...began the mother as her fingers stopped tying the silky stems of flowers together.
    "\"What is the most painful thing that exists in this world?\""
    The daughter looked up from her imperfect flower crown, caught off guard by her mother's sudden question.
    "\"Um... I'm not sure, Mama. What is it?\""
    The daughter replied, unsure of where the conversation was going.
    The mother chuckled softly - a hint of sadness hidden in it - and placed her flower crown beside her.
    "\"Our curse.|""
    The mother muttered under her breath, barely whispering.
    She suddenly stood up, causing her daughter to tilt her head to the side.
    "\"Hm? {w=3.0} Are you going somewhere, Mama?\""
    The daughter asked, as her hands holding the flower crown slowly descended to her lap.
    The mother said nothing, a sad smile upon her face, as she turned her back towards her daughter and began to walk forward.
    She had no where in particular she wanted to go.
    She just knew that it was time for her departure.
    "\"W-Wait, Mama!\""
    The daughter called out, as she tried to stand up. {w=2.0} But her legs did not want to move, leaving her immobile on the ground.
    Without turning around, the mother continues to walk forward.
    She can't look back.
    They won't allow her to.
    This is how it was meant to be.
    "\"You still yet to understand the sadness of your ancestors... {w=4.0} Choose your actions wisely, my dear.\""
    The mother spoke in a momentum tone, a light brighter than the sun sparkling between the gaps of trees.
    "\"Mama, wait! {w=1.0} Please wait for me! I-I can't move!\""
    The daughter cried out, confusion and fear stirring up inside her.
    Before her, her mother was slowly going away.
    As confused as the daughter was, she had a feeling that... {w=2.0} she wouldn't be able to see her mother ever again if she goes.
    The poor child began to cry, reaching her small slender fingers towards her mother's back - hoping that in some way her mother would stop.
    But her mother continued to walk forward, towards the light, ignoring her daughter's cries.
    The girl's tears, the ones that she had tried so hard to keep in, began to seep out of her eyes as her vision began to blur, causing the sight of her mother to slowly blend with the colors of the meadow.
    The poor girl was too young to understand any of her Mother's words.
    All she wanted was for her mother to turn around with a smile and apologize, claiming that everything she did was nothing more than a joke.
    The child reached out as far as she could towards her Mother's back, crying out -

    who "Mama!"
    who "Ah...!"
    who "...That dream again..."
    who "...That's right... {w=4.0} It's just a dream..."
    [NVL format]
    A long sigh escaped from my lips as sweat tickled my skin while sliding down my jaw.
    Needing to calm myself, I listened to the soft ticking of the clock and the gentle beeping of the heart monitor.
    How long have I awoken to that same dream? {w=2.0} Possibly for three or four years now...
    Although, now that I think about it, that was the first time that mother had said something to me before she left.
    Before, it used to be nothing more than a simple "goodbye" and leave the child me in the dream.
    Maybe if I fall back to sleep, I can catch up to her and ask what she meant?
    ...No, dreams don't work like that.
    Dreams - at least the ones you have while you're asleep - are meant to fulfill the strongest desires from your heart, right?
    My desire may not be to have my mother leave me, but rather to keep her with me...
    However, the same dream has been replaying in my mind each night for four years. 
    I can predict every single word that will be uttered due to the redundancy of it.
    But even so, I still have no knowledge of why my mother leaves me in the dream.
    Although, I know why she left in real life... {w=3.0} It is the same reason why I live in a hospital.
    Suddenly feeling myself slowly drifting back to sleep, I let out another sigh - much longer than the first - as I wipe off the sweat on my face.
    As much as I wanted to fall into a deep slumber once again, I had a full day ahead of me.
    A day where it should never be wasted.
    I slowly push my body up with my elbows, my eyes lazily fluttering open.
    My eyelids felt heavy and my arms didn't have much feeling in them, but I somehow managed.
    Once I was propped up with my torso limply slouching over my legs, I glanced over to the clock. {w=2.0} It's seven in the morning.
    I woke up right on time as always. {w=1.0} Maybe I really do have an alarm clock embedded in my body that wakes me up.
    I arched my back a little, feeling the tension in my body disappear and began to rub my eyes, yawning in the process.
    I looked over to the right, where the only true window in my room hid behind the thick white curtains.
    It looks like the weather will be nice today, based on the bright light coming out from the bottom of the curtains.
    This room is often cloaked in darkness until the dawn. And even once the sun is out, not a single ray of sunlight penetrates through the curtains.
    To be more precise, room 302 on the third floor of the west wing in the Creed Hospital is where I reside.
    It is the second largest room in the entire hospital, the largest being the delivery room.
    It's a nice room overall, nicely decorated with furniture and large space, but I wish I didn't have so much.
    I shouldn't be the only one who gets all the nice stuff. There are other children who are younger than me that reside in this hospital, after all.
    In fact, I wish I didn't even have any of these extra furniture. {w=1.0} I would trade it all for nothing more than a different colored room and a simple chair next to my bed, with the vase of flowers on the window sill.
    Something like this is probably only me, but when you enter a hospital room, it doesn't feel very welcoming.
    When you enter, the room seems to emit a sad and cold atmosphere, thanks to the gray and gloomy color palette. {w=1.0} The first thing you see is the window and its curtains, which then makes you look at the color of the wall.
    The moment you do, all of the furniture vanishes, as if it was covered by an invisible cloak or disappeared into thin air.
    Recoloring the entire hospital would be nice; it would give each room its unique color of choice.
    Let's see... My room would probably look nice if it was colored... {w=1.0} Green.
    Yes, green is a nice cheerful color! It's one of my favorites!
    But I suppose having every single hospital room recolored with such a bright color palette might give the visitors a slight spasm.
    And that wouldn't be very good. {w=1.0} That would be horrible.

    who "Nyu!"
    Suddenly, a high pitched voice squeaked to my left, snapping me back to reality.
    I looked over to the left and saw my friend and pet, Nyu, land on my bed.
    Using her small and stubby little arms and legs, she managed to wobble over my direction, her small glossy black eyes shining in excitement, and her cute little button nose twitching.
    I smiled at Nyu as she stopped right next to me, a slight look of exhaustion on her face.
    who "Good morning, Nyu. Did you sleep well?"
    n "Nyui!"
    I giggled at her reply, petting her soft pink and white fur.
    Nyu purred in reply to my touch, her ears twitching happily.
    Once she was satisfied with me petting her, Nyu pulled her body away from me and began to rummage through her small bag that is meant to hold emergency medicines for me.
    who "What are you doing, Nyu? Did you hide something in there?"
    Nyu ignored my questions as she continued to look around in her small bag.
    After a moment of silence and rummaging, Nyu pulled out a small note card and practically thrust it at me.
    I hesitantly took the card from Nyu's paws, smiling nervously at Nyu's forward behavior.
    Looking down at the card, I noticed that it appeared to be blank.
    I glanced over to Nyu, not knowing why she had given this to me.
    n "Nyu!"
    Nyu pointed at the card with confidence, huffing excitedly.
    I glanced back to the card, wondering what secrets it had.
    I began to twirl the card around, eyeing each corner of it for clues when I notice three letters on the back.
    who "\"H.B.C"\...?"
    I tilted my head in confusion at the three mysterious letters.
    I had a feeling that they meant something, but as I was still groggy from my sleep, I couldn't interpret the meaning.
    Was it some sort of secret code? {w} A code that could release Nyu's true form of ultimate fluffiness?!
    ...No, of course not. {w=1.0} That would be ridiculous.
    Exciting, but ridiculous.
    After a moment, I gasped softly in realization. 
    Today is my fourteenth birthday.
    On instinct at the realization, my shoulders slumped, as if trying to dampen the mood.
    Today is also the fourteenth anniversary of my Mother's death.
    She had died the very same day, if not the exact moment, I was born.
    Today is a day of joy, and yet it is also a day of sadness.
    A majority of my friends mainly remembered today as Mother's death...
    With a soft sigh, I quickly shook my head at the thought of "sadness", not wanting to ruin my birthday.
    I'm sure my mother wouldn't have wanted me to be sad on such a special day.
    The \"H.B.C\" must stand for \"Happy Birthday Celia.\" {w} They are the three letters that Nyu could manage to write.
    I looked over to Nyu and smiled.
    c "Thank you for the present, Nyu! {w=1.0} Your handwriting has really improved!"
    n "Nyu!"
    Nyu triumphantly placed her paws on where her hips would be, her ears twitching happily.
    I giggled at Nyu's response, gently petting her head.
    Suddenly, my stomach growled at me, demanding for food.
    Nyu squeaked in surprise at the sudden growl, jerking backwards.
    I giggled at Nyu's tumble from my stomach and looked over to the clock again. 
    It's 7:25.
    c "Oh dear, it's almost 7:30 already? {w=1.0} She's running a little late, isn't she?"
    I heard Nyu squeak in reply, agreeing with me.
    Right as the clock struck 7:26, my personal nurse, Meadow, opened the door, carrying a tray of food.
    m "Good morning, Miss Celia! {w=2.0} Good morning to you as well, Nyu!"
    I raised an eyebrow at Meadow's greeting, surprised at what she has called me.
    That was the first time she had called me \"Miss Celia\".
    c "Good morning, Miss Meadow!"
    Meadow blinked several times in surprise as she stopped beside the bed, a surprised look on her face.
    m "Huh? {w=3.0} {i}Miss{/i} Meadow?"
    I couldn't help but chuckle nervously at Meadow's response. 
    Did she not notice how she called me \"Miss Celia\"?
    c "Well, you called me \"Miss Celia\"". {w} I'm assuming that this is a new name game?"
    Meadow blinked in surprise before laughing at my explanation, placing the tray of food on my lap.
    m "No, no, it's not a name game!"
    m "I've been ordered to call you \"Miss Celia\" as a symbol of your 14th birthday. You're practically a young lady now!"
    I puffed out my cheeks in slight disapproval at her \"orders\", feeling like it was a bit unnecessary.
    Meadow giggled at my reaction and pinched my cheeks, causing me to smile a little.
    m "Come on, no need to be like that! Orders are orders, Celia. There is nothing I can do."
    I smiled sadly in understanding as Meadow let go of my cheeks.
    I looked down to my lap, where the glorious sight of my breakfast lay on top of the tray.
    Mixed with the bitter smell of ketchup, crisp bread and salted butter, the smell of the freshly cooked eggs and rice began to waft its way towards my nose, causing my stomach to growl once again but louder this time.
    Meadow couldn't help but laugh at the sound of my growling stomach.
    m "Wow, that was a loud one! You must be really hungry today, huh?"
    c "Hehe... Well, yes. {w=1.0} After all, you were six minutes later than usual."
    m "Ah, I'm sorry about that. I overslept this morning."
    I couldn't help but laugh a little at her excuse. 
    I see she is quite honest as usual.
    After laughing, I began to eat my food as Meadow took the clipboard from the end of my bed and wrote down the complicated numbers on the heart monitor.
    The morning has always been my favorite part of the day.
    Perhaps it's because I get to drink a nice cup of honey milk.
    Sweet silky honey melted in the smooth texture of hot milk...
    Here in the hospital, milk is only actually available in the morning.
    If you miss your chance now, you don't get to drink milk for the entire day.
    It's a strange rule for some - especially me, as I love milk.
    Suddenly, I heard a loud and stressed disarray of voices coming from the other side of the door.
    Surprised by the sound of the voices, I slowly stopped eating as Meadow turned her attention towards the door.
    c "Huh? {w=2.0} What's going on out there?"
    m "Sounds like a victim from an accident..." 
    m "But your room is almost soundproof, so the fact that we can hear them is..."
    Meadow's words trailed off as she stared intently at the door.
    Meadow placed her clipboard back onto my bed, a stern expression forming on her face.
    m "You stay here, Miss Celia. Whatever you do, do not leave your room."
    I blinked in surprise at Meadow's order, rather confused by her words.
    Stay in my room...?
    I always stay in my room and can't even leave it unsupervised... 
    So why would today be any different?
    Before I could open my mouth to ask Meadow why she had told me to stay in my room when it was such a common thing for me, she swiftly turned around and left, the door closing gently behind her.
    I stare at the door in surprise and confusion, Meadow's chocolate brown hair fluttering out of my view.
    c "... {w=1.0} Something isn't right..."
    n "Nyu?"
    I could hear the panicked voices coming from the hallway and the emergency room on the first floor, where many of the victims are transported to the west wing for surgical purposes.
    Vehicle accidents aren't common in this town, but when they occur the staff knows what to do and is always calm about the procedure.
    If they are making so much noise from three floors down, this isn't an average accident victim.
    ...
    Hm, what should I do?
