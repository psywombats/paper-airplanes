    The time was now 8:30, and Meadow still hadn't returned. [Pause] Something terrible really must have happened.
    I hope not too many people were hurt...
    Thankfully, the cries of panicked voices died down half an hour ago. [Pause] Everything must have gotten settled around then.
    n "Nyu! Nyu nyui, nyu nyu, nyui!"
    Nyu puffed out her cheeks in frustration as she weakly but indignantly stomped her little paw on the bed.
    Nyu and I decided to play a game of charades while we waited for time to pass by.
    Nyu naturally isn't very good at the game. [Pause] She can only do so much without a real pair of hands, so it is rather easy to tell what she is trying to say.
    c "Hehe, having trouble figuring out what to do next?"
    n "Nyuuu...!"
    I couldn't help but giggle at Nyu's frustrated response; I see that she is trying to act stubborn.
    As Nyu continued to ponder about what she should do, the door opened, catching my attention.
    c "Meadow!"
    m "Heh, I'm back! [Pause] Did you miss me?"
    I giggled at Meadows words as she walked towards me. Her normal bright smile plastered on her face.
    I turned as much of my body as I could toward her, slowly gathering courage to ask her about the commotion from earlier.
    c "So, Meadow... [Pause] I'm sorry, but I have been curious about it. What happened downstairs on the first floor? Was it just another accident victim?"
    Meadow's eyes widened slightly as she stared at me in silence.
    She looked at me as if she had no knowledge of what I was speaking about.
    Meadow closed her eyes, deep in thought.
    m "... [Pause] No, it wasn't."
    I blinked twice in slight confusion by Meadow's frank answer.
    c "Well... If it wasn't an accident victim, what happened?"
    m "... [Pause] Let's just say that it's a rare case."
    "A rare case..?" [Pause] Even though I could tell that there was some hesitation in Meadow's words, I could hear the pure sincerity behind her explanation.
    ...However, I had a feeling that this was the best Meadow was willing to share with me at the moment.
    m "Anyway, because it is a rare case... [Pause] The victim will be staying up here on the third floor. He was hurt pretty badly, and so we will need to be monitored daily."
    c "Oh, I see..."
    I couldn't help but pity the poor soul.
    The third floor of the hospital was where the people who were greatly injured or couldn't take care of themselves had to stay. [Pause] Almost all of the residents on this floor are above the age of 55.
    c "Oh! I have an idea!"
    m "Hmm?"
    c "May I please welcome the new resident? [Pause] After being in such a horrible accident, they must be very scared and possibly even lonely."
    m "Absolutely not."
    I flinched in surprise at Meadow's quick response, thrown off completely by her sudden serious expression.
    m "Miss Celia, I would prefer it if you did not go any where near the new resident."
    c "Eh...?"
    m "Do not go near any strangers you might see."
    c "...A-Alright..."
    m "Good."
    Despite Meadow's new carefree smile, I couldn't help but sense a more serious and slightly terrifying atmosphere emitting from her.
    I don't even know what the new resident looks like, and Meadow is telling me not go anywhere near them.
    ...
    I can't help but become more and more curious about this new resident...
    [Transition]
    It is now 11:30 in the morning, which is half an hour before lunch time.
    Nyu and I had moved on to drawing portraits of each other. [Pause] And of course, she isn't very good at that either.
    c "And... [Pause] Done!"
    c "Well? What do you think?"
    n "Nyu..."
    Nyu shook her head in disapproval of my hard work, causing me to giggle nervously.
    c "Oh come on, it isn't that bad..."
    Nyu puffed out her cheeks, placing her stubby paws on her hips.
    It looks like she isn't going to change her opinion.
    c "Well I think it looks good enough..."
    As I stared at my picture of Nyu, a sudden knock on the door caught my attention.
    c "Ah, come in!"
    ??? "Yo! Good morning, Celia."
    c "Oh, Toma! Good morning to you."
    n "Nyu!"
    Surprised by Toma's greeting, Nyu ears enlarged and she flew towards Toma's face.
    t "Whoa there, Nyu! Not the face!"
    I laughed a little as I watched Toma attempting to remove Nyu, who was tightly gripping his face.
    t "Whew... Does Nyu have an interest in faces or something?"
    c "Hehe, that is probably the only way she knows to greet you."
    t "I hope so, or else Nyu and I will be having a little bit of trouble getting along."
    I giggled at Toma's humorous behavior as Toma walked toward me, dropping Nyu on my lap.
    c "So Toma, what brings you here?"
    t "Just wanted to see if you wanted to walk around and stretch your legs today."
    c "Alright, that sounds nice! [Pause] I haven't gotten out of bed in a while."
    t "Cool! I'll put your device on mobile mode then."
    My "device"... [Pause] A strange name that Toma and I call my IV stand.
    I couldn't help but pout slightly at the word as I slid my legs off of the bed.
    Even if I needed to go to some place close by, I had to bring my IV bag everywhere with me. [Pause] I didn't mind it at first...
    But as I grew older, the bag of IV started to become a nuisance.
    I couldn't do a lot of things because of the bag weighing me down. [Pause] If I held it in one arm, it was too painful for me, the needles would move barely an inch and scrape my vein.
    But after meeting Toma, the needles that usually hook to the IV bag itself now detach and hook up to a small vial that I can hold in one hand without hurting myself.
    But because of how small the vial is, my time out of my room is very limited.
    [outside of Celia's room]
    The moment I stepped out of my room, I stretched my arms as far as I could, a hum of delight escaping me.
    I giggled as Toma closed the door, his back facing me, and ran to the room across from me.
    t "Hey, Celia! [Pause] No running in a hospital, remember?"
    I took a sharp turn to the right, running towards Toma with a happy and carefree smile.
    c "Hehe, I'm sorry! [Pause] I couldn't help myself."
    t "Well, obviously."
    I let out a short laugh at Toma's words, feeling a different presence behind them.
    c "It's such a nice day today! The hallway is rather warm, thanks to the sunlight! [Pause] Such a shame we can't go outside to the garden."
    t "You know the rules, Celia."
    c "Yes, of course I know..."
    Ever since my incident four years ago, I haven't had permission to step outside of the hospital. [Pause] Not that I was able to go very far back then, either...
    But the small things most people see in the outside world are what I miss the most. [Pause] Not being able to experience the seasons can really put a damper on your mood.
    The things like the nice gentle breeze during the spring, the steaming hot sunlight dancing on your skin in the summer, the splendid sight of pure white snow nestled on the ground during winter, or the lovely colors of the leaves during autumn...
    I even miss the gentle concertos of the rain, ellegantly playing music with what it touches and splashing cool water on any human near by.
    I had truly enjoyed the simple things like that when I was younger.
    For me... [Pause] It proved that I was truly alive, living in this world and experiencing continuously progressing time.
    I suppose the nice part about staying in the hospital every day is that I get to stay nice and dry though.
    t "So Celia, what do you want to do? [Pause] Do you have anywhere in particular you want to go?"

            c "Hey, Toma! Let's go and have some flan today!"
            t "Haha! Sounds good!"
            Toma and I began to walk down the hallway, happily talking with enthusiasm about the flan that the two of us had grown to love.
            The cafeteria was in the main hospital building on the second floor, which meant that we had to take one of the long narrow hallways.
            Those hallways, leading to either the main building or the west wing where those like myself who cannot escape fate stay, are the most beautiful.
            Windows that reached the ceiling, making everything in the outside visible, could take your breath away.
            The hospital courtyard just so happened to be right below those hallways, letting the people walking down the hallway see the tall dark green trees, the marbled architecture of fountain of Ion, and the bright beautiful flowers.
            Visitors often stopped in the middle of the hallway, taking in the beautiful view.
