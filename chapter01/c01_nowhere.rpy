    c "I don't have anywhere particular in mind. {w=1.0} I just want to walk around and stretch my legs."
    t "Huh? Seriously? {w=1.0} That's kind of boring, isn't it?"
    I giggled a little as I threw my arms up into the air.
    c "But it has been a while since I've walked around! {w=1.0} And the two of us can chat while walking!"
    Toma raised an eyebrow at my explanation, a mischievous look in his eyes as his lips curled up into a smile.
    t "Oh~? {w=2.0} You missed talking with me did you?"
    c "Hehe, I know you certainly have!"
    Toma threw his head back as he laughed, knowing the truth behind my words.
    t "You got that right. {w=1.0} It's boring working hour after hour with no one to talk to, except for a strict man occasionally.
    I giggled at Toma's words, and the two of us began to walk.
    With no specific location, we were able to go freely as we pleased. Nothing chaining us down.
    The feeling of freedom, one that only residents of the third floor in the west wing could have, is simply amazing.
    Of course, almost every other resident was given more freedom than I was. {w=1.0} I could only walk around like this if I was being supervised by someone eligible.
    t "Hey, you're 14 now, right?"
    I gasped softly in surprise as I smiled pleasingly at Toma.
    c "You remembered my birthday!"
    Toma scoffed, as if offended.
    t "Hey, come on now! You gotta give me more credit than that! {w=2.0} The two of us always celebrate your birthday! So of course I would remember."
    I covered my mouth with the back of my right hand, suppressing my laughter at Toma's reaction.
    c "You're right, I apologize."
    Toma and I have been friends for four years now, going all the way back to when I was 9 1/2 and when he was 12.
    As a way of making me happy, Toma had dragged me around the whole hospital on my tenth birthday, buying me flan for the first time.
    The two of us had never tried it back then, and started to grow a burning passion for its sweet flavor and silky smooth texture.
    t "Man, you're a little lady now. {w=2.0} And I mean that literally."
    Toma placed a hand on top of my head and his other hand on top of his own head, as if measuring the distance between us.
    I giggled, swatting away his hand from my head.
    c "I think being five feet is reasonably tall for my body type and figure!"
    t "Haha, no it's not! {w=1.0} You should at least be five three by now!"
    I blinked in surprise at Toma’s information.
    c "Really? Well then what about you? {w=1.0} You're five eight right now, so shouldn't you be six feet?"
    Toma stiffened at my words for a split second before laughing nervously.
    t "It's different for guys."
    c “Huh?"
    t "Well you see, it's all about-"
    who "Out of the way, kids!
    Interrupting Toma, a loud raspy voice cried out to us as the sound of wheels gradually got louder.
    I looked ahead, where a couple of elderly men and women began to rush towards us in wheelchairs, their faces set in concentration.
    I squeaked in surprise as Toma dragged me to the side along with himself, mere seconds before the leading elderly woman ran me over.
    I blinked in surprise as the wind from the wheelchairs blew over Toma and I, causing our clothes to sway in the same direction.
    t "Hey! {w=1.0} I thought the nurses told you all not to do any more wheelchair races!"
    An elderly man, who was in the back of the group of racing elders, turned his wheelchair around to face us while the others laughed and argued.
    elderly_a "Wahahaha! {w=1.0} You youngsters think you can order us around?! My, has the youth fallen."
    t "Heh heh, well the nurses and us helpers are taking care of you, you know? {w=1.0} If you can't realise that, then is it the wise who have fallen."
    elderly_a "Quite the sassy little thing as always, eh Toma?"
    t "Heh, you better believe it old man."
    This caught the rest of the elders attention, causing an elderly woman near the back of the group to turn and face as like the elderly man.
    elderly_b "So rude to your elders! {w=1.0} We know that you are trying to impress your little girlfriend by acting tough, but please do so with a little more manners!"
    t "H-Huh?! {w=4.0} G-Girlfriend?! W-What gave you that idea?!"
    The elders began to laugh, their raspy voices cackling.
    I looked over to Toma, whose face was burning bright red with embarrassment. 
    I smiled at little at Toma's expression, finding it confusing that he was acting strangely.
    t "Y-You got the wrong idea! {w=4.0} Celia and I... W-We aren't...!"
    c "What are you talking about Toma? I am your girl friend, aren't I?"
    t "HUH?!"
    Toma jumped at my words, the tips of his ears turning as red as a cherry.
    For some reason, the elders \“ooh\"ed and \“ahh\"ed at the scene before them, some of the elderly woman giggling like children.
    c "Well, I am a girl and your friend, correct? {w=1.0} So, I'm your girl friend!"
    Toma's red face turned pale in seconds, as his once gaping mouth closed shut.
    t "Ah, that's right. {w=1.0} That's very true."
    The elders began to laugh once again, those who didn't need a wheelchair standing up and patting Toma on the back.
    I smiled warmly at the scene, finding it comforting but very confusing as well.
    elderly_a "Well, how about another round gang?"
    The elderly cheered in delight, wobbling over to their wheelchairs in delight.
    I smiled brightly at the sight, turning to Toma and tugged on one of his white sleeves.
    c "Hey Toma, can I race with them too? I want to go wheelchair racing!"
    t "Huh? {w=3.0} Oh, uh, sorry Celia but you can't."
    c "Aw, why not?"
    t "Well, you're just so slow they'll beat you before you even start pushing the wheels!"
    c "Huh?! That's not very nice!"
    t "Hahah! {w=1.0} Hey, don't look so mad!"
    t "They most likely don't have any extra wheelchairs with them. {w=1.0} Maybe next time, okay?"
    c "Hmm... Alright."
    I waved goodbye to the elderly as Toma and I began to continue walk around.
    [Transition]
    Toma and I walked across the wing, entering the third floor of the main building.
    The third floor was used as some sort of relaxation center, where a majority of hospital residents and their visitors hung out in.
    Despite the rather large number around, the area was quiet and had a relaxing atmosphere.
    Toma and I stopped walking for a bit, examining the area. 
    People of different ages were sitting down, all chatting happily about whatever they wanted.
    I smiled at the sight of a little girl, talking happily with her mother and father.
    Despite the little girl's mother's wearing a hospital gown, the family looked so happy together.
    As I continued to look around the room, I noticed a young man wearing bandages on his head, smiling sheepishly as he spoke to an older woman. {w=1.0} Most likely his mother.
    I began to remember about the commotion from this morning, the new resident of the third floor...
    I never found out who they were or how they ended up there.
    Sure, Meadow told me some information, but it doesn’t really answer the many questions I had in my head.
    I turned my attention to the nurses' station in the left corner, where nurses were smiling gently at the sight of all the happy patients.
    I smiled at them as a few noticed me, and began to walk over to them.
    The head nurse of the station, a friendly woman with long black hair tied into a bun, noticed me walking towards her and gave a warm smile.
    c "Good afternoon!"
    nurse "Well, good afternoon. {w=1.0} It's rare to see you two together!"
    I looked over my shoulder and saw Toma standing right next to me, his hands tied behind his head. 
    Without even noticing, he had followed me to the nurses station.
    It was only natural, seeing as how he could never leave me by myself. {w=5.0} But for some reason, I felt a little upset about it.
    t "Well, today's special."
    nurse “Oh?"
    t "It's Celia's birthday today! {w=1.0} I thought it'd be nice to celebrate by having lunch together."
    I looked at Toma in surprise.
    We’re going to eat lunch together? {w=2.0} That means we get to eat flan today~!
    The nurse began to giggle in a mischievous way, the other nurses in the station smiling brightly at us.
    nurse "My, how kind of you Toma~!"
    t "H-Hey! {w=2.0} What's with that look you're giving me?"
    The nurse didn't reply, as she and the others began to giggle.
    Toma sighed while scratching his head in nervousness.
    t "Come on, first the old folks now you guys? {w=4.0} Seriously, it's not like that..."
    I looked over to Toma in confusion, our eyes locking which caused him to flinch.
    Toma looked away as his face reddened slightly, causing the nurses giggling to arise.
    nurse "Anyway, what can we help you with?"
    c "Oh, right!"
    c "There was some sort of commotion earlier this morning, down in the emergency rooms. {w=1.0} Meadow had told me that the third floor received a new resident."
    c "And, well, I was wondering what happened to them."
    The nurses fell silent, their once smiling faces transforming into ones that showed discomfort.
    I waited patiently for an answer, watching the nurses exchange nervous glances with one another.
    t “... {w=5.0} A wreck."
    I turned my attention to Toma, who had returned to normal, his eyes closed as if he was recalling something.
    c “A wreck?"
    Toma nodded, opening his eyes and instantly locked with the nurses in front of him.
    I looked over to the nurse’s, just in time to see them begin to nod - agreeing with Toma's claim.
    c "Oh, so it was just another accident victim?"
    t “Not exactly."
    t "The person lost something valuable to them, and needs to be supervised. {w=2.0} It is, after all, the reason they are a third floor resident."
    c "Oh, I see..."
    I looked down at my feet and wiggled my bare toes.
    Meadow and Toma’s stories match, which is a good thing, but it still doesn’t really give me all the answers I wanted.
    Why was there such a commotion when it happened?
    Why doesn’t Meadow want me to meet with this new resident?
    Nothing makes sense...
    And what did they lose?
    A body part? {w=0.5} Something of a momento? {w=1.0} Or maybe... Someone important to them...
    My heart instantly went out to them at the mere thought of losing someone, the familiar feeling of loneliness dwelling inside me.
    c "How awful... {w=6.0} I wish I could have helped them out in some way."
    t "It's not your fault for their loss, Celia. {w=2.0} There was nothing anyone could have done."
    My body tensed at Toma curt words.
    There was truth in what he said, but I couldn't help but think otherwise.
    Couldn't there have been something, {i}anything{/i} that someone could have done? {w=4.0} Anything at all?
    Humans have the ability to choose what fate they want to have, and my mother was proof of that in the beginning.
    The fact that there was nothing someone could have done to save the accident victim... {w=5.0} It hurts me.
    After another ten minutes or so, Toma's stomach began to growl.
    With the fun air from earlier now back, the two of us said goodbye to the nurses and made our way to the second floor of the main hospital where the cafeteria awaited us.
