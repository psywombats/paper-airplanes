I’m a little curious about what’s happening downstairs...
I don’t think it would hurt to go and see what is going on.
I muster as much courage as I can and moved my breakfast tray to the side and slid off my blanket, letting my feet hit the ground.
n "Nyu!"
I looked over to Nyu, who was giving me quite the stern look behind her glossy eyes.
c "I'm just a little curious Nyu. I won't be gone for too long, alright?"
n "Nyu…"
I gave her a quick reassuring smile as I unhooked my bag of IV and carried it gently in my arms.
Leaving Nyu by her lonesome, I walked over to the door and hesitantly opened it.
I must be honest with myself. [Pause] I was a little nervous.
Many people come to this hospital for a variety of different purposes, ranging from casual checks ups to drastic emergencies.
If I head down there, I might see something horrible...
I shook my head, pushing the negative and fearful thoughts out. [Pause] I will only be there for a moment, take a glance of the situation, and then leave before anyone can notice me.
With a confident nod, I took a proud step out of my room.
Stealthfully, I walked towards the elevator. [Pause] It would be a lot more troublesome to take the stairs.
The other doctors and nurses would have a higher chance of noticing me if I took the stairs, [Pause] and they would instantly notice me thanks to the incident four years ago.
Once I reached the elevator, I quickly pressed the button five times in desperation while looking both to the left and right, making sure not to get myself caught..
I took a step back and patiently waited for the elevator. I heard two low voices- most likely two men- shouting. [Pause] Their voices were mixed with the rapid sounds of stomping footsteps.
I gasped softly in worry, trying to find a place to hide.
Man’s Voice "Did... see... poor kid?!"
I froze in place at the one of the voice’s words. [Pause] A child… Could this be about the noise downstairs?
What happened? [Pause] Why does the man sound like he is in such a panic?
Because of how loud the footsteps were, I couldn’t hear everything they were saying.
Other Man’s Voice "His entire… blown off! This… is getting… hand!"
"Blown off?" [Pause] Something from that child was blown off?
Why? [Pause] By what?
Wha… What is going on beyond the walls of the hospital...?!
Man’s Voice "We need to… Silver… there!"
Other Man’s Voice "You’re right, there… much blood…!!"
What…? [Pause] Blood…?
Suddenly, my heart began to pound as if trying to escape my body and run far away from the frightening words.
c "..."
c "...Ngh..."
My body becomes tight; I found myself frozen in place.
My eyes strain to stay open as I stood there, motionless aside from my throbbing heart. [Pause] Something wasn’t right.
The panicked voices of the men started to blend with their footsteps, fading away into an abyss, where I couldn’t hear anything.
My chest… hurts…! [Pause] I-I’m scared...
What’s going on?
My knee trembled, ready to lose their strength as my heartbeat rang in my ears like the lasting notes from a base drum.
Each breath I took stabbed my body; waves of pain flow through my body endlessly.
It hurts… [Pause] So much...
Slowly, my blood began to turn cold… [Pause] My heartbeat stops as a momentum sound rings in my ears.
My legs now feel numb as I let out a soft sigh.
My eyelids suddenly because heavy, closing against my will and blocking me out of the vivid world I was in only moments ago...
The next thing I knew, everything became still...
[Game Over]
