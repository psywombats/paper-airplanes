    [Chapter 2: Curse the World]
    [NVL]
    Screaming... [Pause] The sounds of pure agony.
    The sounds of metal clashing with one another and the high-pitched screeching sound ringing in the fighter's ears.
    It doesn't take a genius to know that this was a fight.
    A fight... [Pause]to the death.
    A paralyzing pain enveloped my left shoulder, and my head was spinning as blood gushed out onto the jacket of my defeated opponent. 
    Is it my blood? [Pause] Or maybe it was his? 
    I'm no longer sure myself. [Pause] All that matters is that I'm still breathing. 
    That I'm still alive.
    "Stupid! I told you to keep your distance! [Pause] Now look what happened!"
    A husky voice shouted near my ear. I immediately recoiled in frustration, gritting my teeth to suppress it.
    I couldn't find the energy to move a muscle against them.
    That voice who sounded so rough and angry made me slightly relaxed even in this chaotic environment. 
    After all, they're my partners. 
    He held my shoulder tightly, his nails digging through my torn skin as he guided me somewhere into a dark woods.
    The screams of the fighters became obscured by the strong wind that seemed to have screamed in pain as well. 
    What was left was the sound of our footsteps splashing on the muddy forest ground and the rustling of the leaves and bushes that we passed by. 
    The sudden change of environment was just...
    Surreal.
    "Ugh, you're... [Pause] Dripping blood everywhere! [Pause] It... It took your arm straight off!"
    I gritted my teeth in pain, blindly moving my feet in sync with my partner. 
    I couldn't even process what he just said. [Pause] We just kept on hopping over obstacles in our way, like wingless birds.
    "Alright, [Pause] listen closely, Kid."
    My partner began, his words struggling to form between pants as we ran.
    "There's a... [Pause] Norhillian town near here, just beyond... the woods. [Pause] It's called ‘Arkala', and it is the best hospital... [Pause] in Norhill."
    "Because of the recent circumstances, and... [Pause] your uniform being all ripped apart, they'll take you in... and help you out."
    I listened to the instructions, my head becoming light as each drop of crimson blood escaped from my body. 
    The feeling of blood flowing out of my shoulder sent shivers down my spine; the pulse of my heart pounded against my Adam's apple. 
    I'm a pessimistic person, but I really do hope that I'll still be alright.
    The cries of agony had completely vanished, and the strong wind drifted them away as twinkling lights began to from beyond the trees.
    We had probably arrived at the edge of the Norhillian town... [Pause] ‘Arkala.'
    Before exiting the woods, my partner halted to a stop. My weak form would have nearly flied past him if it weren't for his strong grip on my shoulder.
    The sound of his heavy breathing echoed through the tranquil night sky, reaching any living creature beyond the trees we hid behind.
    "Now... [Pause] I can't go... [Pause] With you all in the way. [Pause] After all, we don't want the... others to get suspicious, so I'm... [Pause] going to go back to fight with them."
    "I'll tell them that... [Pause] you went off somewhere to do some snooping."
    "Don't... [Pause] get too comfortable there, got it? [Pause] As soon as you can walk, get outta there... [Pause] and return to the base."
    "Got it... [Pause] Kenta?"
    [ADV format]
    My eyes shot open, sweat rolling down my back.
    I was surrounded by darkness. Despite my horrifying dream, a comfortable and warm cloth is pressed against my now sweaty back and another cloth gently covering my body.
    I quickly sat up, and sharp pain simultaneously stabbed throughout my left side.
    My breathing hitched and I began to feel lightheaded. I placed my my right hand on the soft surface to support my balance.
    I squeezed my eyes shut at the pain, staying in the same position and waiting until the pain on the left side of my body ceased.
    After a few moment of silence, I slowly reopened my eyes and glanced over to my left shoulder.
    Through the darkness, I was able to see the outline of something short that only stopped above my pecs.
    Unconsciously, as if I was watching it happen outside of my own body, my right arm reached towards my left shoulder and grabbed the mysterious object.
    It felt like... [Pause] Cloth. To be more precise, it was a sleeve made out of cotton.
    My blood went cold as my fingers slowly grabbed onto half of the sleeve, continuously heading towards my shoulder and still not making any contact with my skin.
    My entire left arm had been amputated...?
    That can't be right, I still had five inches worth of my arm when it first happened!
    I began to panic, circling my covered wound on my shoulder; reality slowly dawned on me.
    Soon, an annoying beeping sound entered my ears, causing me to quickly look around me. [Pause] My eyes quickly met with a strange device to my right.
    It was a strange box, a green line moving up and down in sync with the beeping.
    My breathing started to become faster as sweat rolled down my forehead.
    With each beeping sound that echoed in the darkness I sat in, apprehension welled up in my chest.
    Make it stop... [Pause] Make the fucking beeping stop!
    ???: "Sir, it looks like he's awake."
    My head veered sharply to the sound of a woman's voice. [Pause] A familiar woman and a man with similar colored outfits stood in front of a door, and dim light entered the darkness.
    ???: "Yes, it appears so..."
    I swallowed the imaginary lump that formed inside my throat, my body becoming tense as the man walked towards me while the woman left the room.
    Through the dim light, I could see that the man had a pair of unique eyes...[Pause] Eyes that seemed lifeless accompanied with an icy frown.
    k "..."
    ???: "Welcome to Creed hospital, Mr. Clow. [Pause] I am the director, Silver Creed."
    Man "I do apologize for not visiting you earlier this morning."
    k "..."
    The man named ‘Silver' extended his hand to me, his eyes and stiff face remaining the same.
    I stared at his hand, deciding whether or not to take it.
    menu:
        "Shake his hand":
            Hesitantly, I extended my right hand to his and gently grabbed his hand. [pause] They were cold...like ice.
            With a firm grip and a shake, I drew my hand back to my side.
            s "Now then Mr. Clow... [Pause] I have a few questions for you, if it is alright."
            I stared at Silver for a moment, adjusting my seating before nodding slowly in reply.
            s "Well, to start off... [Pause] Are you really a soldier?"
            I nodded, my eyes locked with his lifeless ones.
        "Don't shake his hand":
            I looked up at the man, glaring at him to show that I had no intention to take his hand.
            s "Right... [Pause] Well then."
            The man withdrew his hand back to his side, and he clenched his hands.
            s "Now then, Mr. Clow... [Pause] I have a few questions for you, if it is alright."
            I glared at the man for a moment, adjusting my seating before nodding slowly in reply.
            s "Well, to start off... [Pause] Are you really a soldier?"
            I nodded, my eyes locked with his lifeless ones.
    
    s "... [Pause] Right, well... [Pause] You are fighting against the Civix correct? 
    s "Your uniform was in terrible condition when you threw yourself into my emergency room... [Pause] So it was rather hard to tell."
    I nodded.
    s "... [Pause] Good, [Pause] well that makes things rather easier for us."
    The man snapped his fingers, the familiar woman he stood next to before entering the room with a tray of food at hand.
    s "This is Meadow Allen, one of my trusted nurses. She will be monitoring your condition and take care of you during your stay here."
     s "Since you are a soldier for our country, and with these horrible circumstances, you don't have to worry too much about the fees. [Pause] As long as you keep Norhill safe, you don't have to repay us."
    I raised an eyebrow at the man's words, finding it strange that I didn't have to pay even a single palik to this man for taking care of me.
    Usually, most ‘soldiers' would have a discount at hospitals that were not meant for soldiers at all.
    And it's rather strange that the man would be so carefree about my age and position as a working soldier. [Pause] I clearly look too young to work as a soldier, and yet... [Pause] He isn't.
    Something is definitely strange about this man. [Pause] I should keep my guard up.
    The woman, ‘Meadow', stood next to the man, and the two began to whisper with one another, making sure that I couldn't hear them.
    My eyes narrowed as I stared intently at the two. [Pause] The man seemed progressively upset with each word that quietly escaped his lips.
    The man pursed his lips after the woman whispered something to him, and the two looked towards me.
    s "Well Mr. Clow, I have to get back to work. [Pause]We will make sure that your stay here is very comfortable for you."
    And with that, the man turned around and left, leaving the woman and me by ourselves in the dimly lit room.
    The room was silent, the annoying beeping from the strange machine continued.
    This woman... [Pause] She was the one who captured me after I had woke up the first time.
    I would have been gone from this place and back at the base if it weren't for her.
    With a short exhale from my nose, I looked away from the woman.
    Nurse "I have some food and medicine for you... [Pause] For your shoulder."
    The woman placed the food down near the edge of the bed, causing me to tense.
    The room grew silent again as something began to tug at my left sleeve.
    I instantly turned my head toward the woman and smacked her hand that had began to roll up my sleeve.
    The woman took a step backwards, holding the hand I had hit close to her chest with a surprised look on her face.
    I gritted my teeth and glared at her, rolling up my sleeve myself. [Pause] No one, except for me can touch my injuries.
    I scanned the tray for some sort of medicine bottle, grabbing a small round container with gel inside.
    Opening the container with a flick of my thumb, I placed the container back down on the tray and scooped up some of the gel with the tip of three of my fingers.
    Nurse "Uh wait, you need to remove the bandage first..."
    I glared at the woman, causing her to close her mouth. [Pause] I could see that there was some frustration forming in her eyes.
    Glancing over to my rolled up sleeve, there was indeed a thick roll of bandages and a strange belt of some sort that tightly secured them over my wound.
    Using my pinky and thumb that were not coated in the strange gel, I somehow managed to remove the belt and bandages then applied the "medicine".
    I gritted my teeth at the pain that spread through my body as I gently rubbed the gel.
    Nurse "You are rather stubborn, aren't you?"
    I snorted in response, rubbing my fingers against the cloth that covered my legs and began to put on the bandages and strange belt.
    The woman walked forward to me and a placed the tray of food on top of my lap, causing me to tense up at the sight of it.
    Nurse "Well, you were asleep for a while so you missed dinner. [pause] Go ahead and eat it."
    The tray consisted of a large bowl of steaming rice, a plate decked with some sort of glistening meat and vegetables, and a cup with some sort of warm white liquid in it.
    I shivered at the sight of the food, all my memories flooding into me at once.
    I picked up the tray with my trembling right hand and threw it past the woman, causing a loud clattering sound to echo inside the room.
    The woman gasped at my actions, turning her attention to the mess near the door, where the tray had landed.
    After a minute or two of silence from the woman, she turned around and glared at me with frustrated and angry eyes. 
    I glared back, taking the action as some sort of threatening position.
    Nurse "What in the name of Ion makes you think that you have the authority to just throw a perfectly well made meal to the wall like that?!"
    Nurse "It doesn't matter if you are a soldier for Norhill or not! [Pause] That was a meal made especially for you! And you threw it at the wall like it was garbage!"
    Nurse "I have another person to take care of who is in a much worse condition than you are!" 
    Nurse "By throwing that food to the wall, you have wasted food that could have helped them or anyone else in this building!"
    Nurse "I was only assigned to help you because everyone else had their hands filled with other patients!" 
    Nurse "I do not appreciate your attitude, and will gladly leave you alone to die in this room if that is what you truly wish!"
    I stared at the woman in shock, frozen by her sudden change of attitude and ice cold tone.
    My body relaxed a bit as I gave the woman an apologetic look for a brief moment before looking away.
    I repositioned my seating and laid down on my right side, my back facing the woman. [Pause] She'll leave after a bit.
    Just as I had predicted, the woman had left my room with a heavy sigh and after she had cleaned the mess I had made.
    Once the room had returned to complete darkness like earlier, the green beeping bar was the only thing keeping the room from getting too dark. I began to examine my left shoulder once again.
    Sharp pains shot through my body, causing my breathing to hitch.
    The beeping sound had increased along with my heart rate and continued to stay that way until I had stopped picking at my wound through the bandages.
    With a silent sigh, I rolled over to my back and stared at the ceiling of the room. 
    Although the room was almost pitch black, I was almost certain that the ceiling was colored a depressing gray.
    ...It's kind of funny at how I could even feel the pain in my shoulder.
    When my arm was amputated, I didn't even feel a thing. [pause] Everything had happened so fast.
    It wasn't until my partner had pointed out my missing arm that I had felt the pain. [pause] I had already lost a large amount of blood by then.
    I snorted at the thought of my "partner" and the situation that I had been pulled into.
    The innocent always get pulled into the worst situations.
    Not that I was ‘innocent' in the first place...
    ...After all, this world has gone straight to the depths of Kxon.
    It's fine by me. [Pause] This world is as bad as the dark lord anyway.
    ...
    ...This world has gone straight to hell.
